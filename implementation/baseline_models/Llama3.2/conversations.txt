what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: experiencing different cultures [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh well uh i love going to mexico. and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but. uh the uh the level of. of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: traveling you mean [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: uh. i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua. and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes. and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible. uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place [Interviewer]: nice what did you study at school [Patient]: i studied biology [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: not at all i'm working in. areas of business now [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: yes i am [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job would be to be a missionary [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very. generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily. but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket. i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that [Interviewer]: yeah sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: i exercise [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i think i'm pretty good at it uh. uh i think i'm pretty effective at it [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend. and it was about her uh lack of consideration [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. i felt frustrated [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hmm. a situation which. i wished i could handle differently um. i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh. be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior. i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that. is so wrong. and so. in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my. displeasure with someone's actions right away and that. uh takes care of the anger immediately [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think. eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end. uh it diffuses trouble rather than. prolongs or protracts the trouble [Interviewer]: that makes sense tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued. uh at length for many. months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to. i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh. uh difficult period. in my life [Interviewer]: i see tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their. uh betrayals uh but now i realize that. keeping those memories make me who i am today and. and dealing with them defines who i am today [Interviewer]: mm tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that. um even though my father was somewhat of a uh. hard-handed uh. and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died. and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother. but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect. me also just. just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil [Interviewer]: i'm sorry how do you cope with them [Patient]: uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um. he's clinically depressed. and he has suicidal tendencies. and uh he's not working he's very highly educated. and he uh well he doesn't talk to me. and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model. he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest. and kind. uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers [Interviewer]: i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two. and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress. i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay. that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future. about whether. i will survive this or not [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: not really [Interviewer]: do you feel down [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: never [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: never [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: oh i was either surfing or snowboarding. or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: funny. jovial. uh uh intelligent a perfectionist [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um. maybe. uh is to submerge my uh. hedonistic self [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um. uh deferrer of gratification. he. put. now behind him and he put what will be in the future. in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was. whereas i am looking always for the present. um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to. uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: <deep breath> it would be. my ex-boss. and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using. uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way. and he continued to use more profanity. until uh. i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred. a year and a half ago [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids [Interviewer]: could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that. that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had. and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because. that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness. because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not. we do not have the highest. uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree [Interviewer]: right i see what you mean what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: mm. that's a good one i would say. <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that. and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so. i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: i. was giving a. rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing. and many of these people have never done it before. and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so. that was very gratifying to me [Interviewer]: that's great what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: <deep breath>. i would say <sigh> my. devotion to. the environment. uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh. i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um. uh a steward. of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are. polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and. i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: you're welcome [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye

because i really don't see that a lot. and uh. he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   [Interviewer]: yeah  what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: excuse me ma'am  [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of

[Interviewer]: what do you do now [Patient]: i'm a photographer  [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what's your dream job  [Patient]: oh. i suppose uh . um. running a family portrait

you like your living situation  [Patient]: um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager. i've i do have free rent but i have to stay. there a lot. so  [Interviewer]: mhm that sucks  [Patient]: that part does the free rent part is very good  [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: oh gosh. my most memorable experience. that's hard to say . um . well. i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind  [Patient]: oh. well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school. there was a few of the things that i was happy about. and. some art pieces i've made were memorable. and . some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though  [Interviewer]: mhm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  [Patient]: uh . well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family  [Patient]: uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a. uh there's a few that are from far <f>. distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and  . my other brother lives in maui <clears throat>  [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what do you think of today's kids [Patient]: oh mostly very talented. <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was. or am and they're um. i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up. just seems like they were all hooked into social media  [Interviewer]: yeah i understand what do you do to relax  [Patient]: uh go on a walk or. watch television  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: or play with my computer . and uh [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: um well . there's some <so> some. uh . there's some kind of uh . injustices that happen in not. not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna  [Interviewer]: oh  [Patient]: uh make any exceptions or change some rules . and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>. uh that are upsetting [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that  [Patient]: uh yeah. i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site  . the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside . and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside. um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained. that we were late setting up when it when they told us. to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and . and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so. uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: that's yeah that's how they do things. so that that is upsetting  [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them  [Patient]: uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are. that might be better. um  [Interviewer]: that's good  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper  [Patient]: uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx. might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that. but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that  [Interviewer]: mhm when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  [Patient]: um. well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we. we were arguing where to go first . and um so we compromised and. did most of her things and one of my things then after . this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so. but it [Interviewer]: that's good  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: have you ever served in the military  [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: uh. no i have not [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression  [Patient]: yes  [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed  [Patient]: oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty. yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty [Interviewer]: that's a long time  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help  [Patient]: um. well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist  [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms  [Patient]: um. well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house . um i was waking up at. noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um. focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough. uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression  [Interviewer]: yeah  did you think you had a problem before you found out  [Patient]: yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was  [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now  [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: why did you stop  [Patient]: uh well. eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that . he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh. and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on. with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days  [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: um. i think therapy makes you see what the um . like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really. you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of. try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately . or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint. and i try to look for clues about that   [Interviewer]: that makes sense  mhm how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: i think i'm um. slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods. i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for. for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important. it um [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and. deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed   [Interviewer]: uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  [Patient]: uh . well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are. probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i. have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um. um. soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with . mm. you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and . the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: eh things like that or um. some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that . where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  [Interviewer]: okay  yeah is there anything you regret  [Patient]: oh you mean in life in general yeah well. i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>. uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. and um didn't really. i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have [Interviewer]: hmm what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: um . i think it would've been to um . at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some. uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics. i had i was an art major and i had no car so  . a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and. and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to  . do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time [Interviewer]: uh huh  [Patient]: so  [Interviewer]: i see what you mean  what would you say are some of your best qualities  [Patient]: um . well i'm i've been told i'm very patient . and also i have um some original original artistic ideas  . so . um those are. those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um . you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them . so [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  [Patient]: um let's see . xxx really enjoyed was i had a . i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently  . i really enjoyed that so  [Interviewer]: i love listening to people talk  okay i think i've asked everything i need to [Patient]: mhm. okay  [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  [Patient]: it was my pleasure  [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: thank you goodbye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: spectacular. this is an interesting experiment [Interviewer]: that's good awesome [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: where are you from originally [Patient]: uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa [Interviewer]: really when did you move to l_a [Patient]: <sigh> uh. may second of two thousand seven. so exactly five years six years ago [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: um. infrequently like once every couple years [Interviewer]: okay how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: uh the weather exists so it's more extreme. and then  it's. rather less. exciting. a lot less colorful [Interviewer]: why did you move to l_a [Patient]: uh winter in minnesota <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: uh it took approximately. the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh. the lights took care of the rest [Interviewer]: wow what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh. i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh. have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love. the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: oh you know. the traffic <sigh>. the exceedingly high cost of living. uh. yeah those are those are my big beefs [Interviewer]: i see what you mean i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: uh not nearly as much as i would like to. i've done a little bit [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: uh i like not. knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to. uh deal with people to. deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh. last year i got to. hang out in san marcos for a little bit. after i split up with my ex. and then. after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: uh. last week. managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia. scrubbed_entry. as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like. national news and. he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group. riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't. bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday. but. our group of friends. is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else [Interviewer]: (laughter that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. <clears throat>. once i found the right group of friends. it was easy to be social it it. drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing. bombastic for the first time and it stuck [Interviewer]: that's great sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out. i i do all sorts of stuff. it um. usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project [Interviewer]: cool how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh what temper <laughter> [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh. scrubbed_entry [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me. and i mostly failed [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: uh. hard on him. i mostly uh mostly got by with. a couple of scrapes on my ego [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: uh. when . when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of. having my <sigh>. verbal gloves up i managed to. take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was. not my most graceful moment [Interviewer]: uh oh what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: uh. i feel guilty about lots of stuff um. i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: 'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy [Interviewer]: (laughter tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was. uh made a lot of hard decisions. i guess <sigh>. it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff. but. it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so. it's a tricky question madam [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: uh oh you know broken collarbone. severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time [Interviewer]: i see tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: <laughter>. mm. no. my memories are important. i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: uh. my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me. uh. my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy. uh. but. since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce [Interviewer]: that's good who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: uh. jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately. she is a magical creature [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh. well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful. there's the part where she. manages to. hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she. actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part. where. she is a hundred percent kind and caring. all the time. all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that. she does this all. without wanting anything in return. i don't know that's. <sigh> smitten <laughter> [Interviewer]: how do you know them [Patient]: uh. <laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know. uh. i know her through my. bicycle friends <sigh> [Interviewer]: cool how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh. the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits. so. i i get to sleep. poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: <deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um mm. because. the universe. in its. infinite. uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor. uh has managed to convince me of the. reality. of magic. in the arthur c clark sense. uh so. as a fortunate and <cough>. vaguely aware being. eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: uh. yeah. uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate. and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time. if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh. i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and. started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. twenty thirteen <laughter>. uh. <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh. an art project that all my friends. helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling [Interviewer]: awesome how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <laughter>. <sigh>. that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. i guess i'm. enthusiastic. i am. thesauric. and i am. <sigh>. i'm gonna have to say. highly analytical <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: uh. it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: uh. like turning on some of the fancier. finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself. <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: uh. that's a really tough one. i think the thing that i'm most proud of. would probably be. <sigh>. you know i'm not actually sure. <laughter> [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <clears throat>. <deep breath>. don't masturbate so much <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter what are some things that usually put you in a good mood [Patient]: uh jackrabbit. really bad puns uh and dessert [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: no problem [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye ellie
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this  [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today   [Patient]: <laughter> . fine how are you [Interviewer]: i'm great thanks where are you from originally [Patient]: uh watts california but now i live in west l_a  [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: <laughter> yes [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city   [Interviewer]: yeah what are some things you don't really like about l_a  [Patient]: the traffic it's terrible  [Interviewer]: i see what you mean  what'd you study at school  [Patient]: i studied child development  [Interviewer]: cool  are you still working in that  [Patient]: yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations  [Interviewer]: awesome what's your dream job  [Patient]: oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies  [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that  [Patient]: well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film [Interviewer]: that's great  [Patient]: <laughter>  [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened  [Patient]: last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  [Interviewer]: what was it about [Patient]: <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally [Interviewer]: mhm that sounds interesting  [Patient]: thanks <laughter>  [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad  [Patient]: really mad uh . <laughter> really mad i. you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  [Interviewer]: uh oh  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: that sucks  [Patient]: <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent  [Patient]: no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that. you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you. you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um. other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   [Interviewer]: yeah  what's the hardest thing about being a parent  [Patient]: <sigh> . the hardest thing about being a parent . i would say is. trying to give. that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so. it gets very uh . um. annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt. it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    [Interviewer]: uh huh that sounds really hard  [Patient]: mm. yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch. but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it. you as a parent you're happy they got it  [Interviewer]: that's good what's the best thing about being a parent  [Patient]: <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs. she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but [Interviewer]: <laughter>  [Patient]: you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for. having the children tell you that you're a good person so. i like that  [Interviewer]: yeah that's so good to hear  [Patient]: hmm [Interviewer]: what do you think of today's kids  [Patient]: oh <laughter> my god they're. ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity. and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but. they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or. you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information. and they just have to fight through all that info

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter> [Interviewer]: uh oh where are you from originally [Patient]: i was born in canada [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: and but i've lived in california most of my life so. and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish [Interviewer]: when did you move to l_a [Patient]: the <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah when did you move to l_a [Patient]: oh my gosh years and years ago [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so. travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: uh huh [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that. it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and. but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with. so [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: why did you move to l_a [Patient]: why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and. this became our home base and uh. that's why [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: easy very easy so [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: uh huh [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that. went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter>. and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. i don't know. can't really pinpoint why <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate. i'm a leasing consultant part time [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: oh. probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at. t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so. but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet. you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter>. <laughter>. oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um. take a walk uh call my friends. million things <laughter> so [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody. cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so [Interviewer]: mhm that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: mhm. mm. i can't really remember. so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i. avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: mm. i can't think of anything right now [Interviewer]: hmm tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: i. really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard. i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision. so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but. since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and. that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: mm. yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: an event. hmm. well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever. so i know when my father died you know i mean. i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but. you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with. that. so [Interviewer]: there are always trade-offs in life aren't there [Patient]: mhm. yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh. philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do. um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot. i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them. so [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm we have a small family [Interviewer]: what do you think of today's kids [Patient]: uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many. types of kids out there i think. majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control. but um. i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very. well-behaved so can't say much else about that [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um. uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but. they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes. run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting. ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll. kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so. i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>. but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of. you know. taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's. i can't say anything to her about that [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: so. yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know. at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but. for now you know that's i'll deal with it so [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but. the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so. you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm. i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean. so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: i um. i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know. whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of. creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies. and. you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no mm mm [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person. and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: hmm. <laughter>. can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so [Interviewer]: okay is there anything you regret [Patient]: no i never regret anything [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: uh huh. what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it. everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um. you know seems like <laughter>. uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um. wasted time with certain people um. i don't know those are the things that come to mind [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: but. mm [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh. i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but. i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and. um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we. you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter> [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: but uh if you want i'll repeat it so [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable. uh. i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener. and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm. don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: hmm. that's a hard question <laughter> the. can't think i mean i'm. can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you like to do for fun [Patient]: for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um. i love going out with my friends. shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips. um. that's kind of. you know. part of it yeah that i mentioned so [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it. um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries. uh the architecture. it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely

working in that [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um. hmm. i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and

huh. i don't know but i really like children and i really like. studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i. i think i'm pretty friendly [Interviewer]: uh huh sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read. um. yeah [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about. other things if i start getting mad or um. i just start trying to focus on my breathing [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend. um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um. i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party. and he was getting frustrated. which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with [Interviewer]: yeah how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and. i. really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out [Interviewer]: i see tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hmm. i think a lot of times when my. oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother. uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close. as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i. and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: hmm. um. when i was nineteen. i came home. from a party. i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things. and then he didn't speak to me for about a year [Interviewer]: i'm sorry tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home. um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could. um <sigh>. and i love my siblings i. again my little sister and i get along really well she's. four years younger than me. and when. when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and. i wasn't. in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore. and that's really great. and. we get along okay with my uh. my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve [Interviewer]: that's good who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: scrubbed_entry. one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good. uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and. who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that [Interviewer]: that's great how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but. generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. well i'm really tired i can get grumpy. but i think usually i'm just. groggy [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: pretty good i'm a little anxious about. um. about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about. it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time. um. yeah [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: <sigh> well. i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: hmm. well i think the last time i felt really happy i. went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party. and um. i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people. and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun [Interviewer]: that's great how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um she would probably say that. i'm smart and uh. pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch. really like serious films and t_v. um. and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so. um so that's a major one that and procrastinating [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: hmm. um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh. uh given. eh. sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was. very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem. like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock. speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job. but it was. was not. great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation [Interviewer]: that sucks what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: well i would've been twelve. and two. um. but i think. i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think. i was a little selfish and self-involved back then [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and. um. i do regret. a couple of. semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a. a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript [Interviewer]: could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: i think so i'm. i think i. i wasn't focusing in school at that time. and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that [Interviewer]: okay tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then. going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges. and then maybe. going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and maybe watching a little bit of t_v [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: huh. well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up. i'm ten years older than him so. and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which. made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and. um and how close we are

oh [Patient]: i was talking on facebook with somebody about it. but i think it's good to. uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh. it's natural to you know. not always agree on

uh identity theft. and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving. um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did    [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry to hear that  [Patient]: thank you  [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: um okay i'm panicky about the job situation . um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now  [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation  [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  [Patient]: um . yeah i mean . well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing  [Interviewer]: that's great  [Patient]: yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink   [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself. now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving  [Interviewer]: that's good  have you been diagnosed with depression  [Patient]: uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um. they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would . make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin . just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state   [Interviewer]: how hard is that yeah did you think you had a problem before you found out  [Patient]: um not really  [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms  [Patient]: always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i. eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed [Interviewer]: yeah  do you feel like therapy's useful  [Patient]: i do. at some point i've had. some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists . um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me. and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen   [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean  what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: um. well i'm not going to therapy now but . the therapy that i had before um . was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication. um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  [Interviewer]: mm why did you stop  [Patient]: um i just. i wasn't getting the right therapists recently. so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know  [Interviewer]: yeah  okay  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  [Patient]: um . i can't really think of anything right now  [Interviewer]: okay  when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: um . it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy  [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that  [Patient]: thank you <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: um . okay when i was a kid. um . i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it . so then a little while later my father . came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them . so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that   [Interviewer]: <laughter> <laughter>  [Patient]: oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences   [Interviewer]: wow that's great  [Patient]: yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so  [Interviewer]: yeah  is there anything you regret  [Patient]: um. just the way that i've treated people before when. i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people. when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable  [Interviewer]: that's good yeah  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: get in a career that is really stable . like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney. something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so. you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  [Interviewer]: yeah that makes sense  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  [Patient]: um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work . uh when i'm helping other people . uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  [Interviewer]: that's great  okay i think i've

i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic. going down a hill. unable to brake. and i'm going down. and suddenly. there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i. turn. sharply. in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic. and then <laughter>

[Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. <deep breath>

moment [Patient]: eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you do. just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me. that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years. like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: and to answer your question. i think thinking about it. the hardest decision i've had to make. is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. xxx <sigh> ooh. um <sigh> where do i begin. <sigh>. um. my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word. um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with. um just to the the people around her and to me. and. i. <deep breath>. <laughter> you know. they say you're supposed to give forgive people. for making mistakes or doing things. and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina.

'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: except when i'm reading. and i like reading [Interviewer]: okay what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it [Interviewer]: okay what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye [Patient]: do i press the button now. oh bye [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: okay

what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um <clears throat>. that would be. um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house. in the midst of. acres and acres and acres of grapes was just. magnificent [Interviewer]: wow what did you study at school [Patient]: um human development [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i. started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant. and um i went to a program. in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant. and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss. i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly. and um so the college offered. human development as a major. and i um. just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired. towards that particular major and. and i'm happy with it [Interviewer]: that's good are you still working in that [Patient]: um currently no i stay at home i have a little one. uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back

<sigh> from them and for them is unconditional [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time. for every age <laughter>. and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: yeah what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages. that's why it makes me crazy. um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents. it was just kinda like. you know is she fed is she dressed. she has a house i mean a roof over her head. and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so. it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of. that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age. every year month. you know <clears throat> and um. so i think it difference differs in that way [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: tremendously [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family [Patient]: very close. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that's good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: outgoing [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: mm. i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited. i. feel a little. you know. confident to

i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um <clears throat> i bead. i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax [Interviewer]: that's great how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i'm pretty good i i. well i think i um. try not to. not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are. when i'm upset. um which is not good. 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out. and um. yeah that. that's uh something i have to work on [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: like exercising or something [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about. um. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage. on him [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: uh really tired of talking about that same topic [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. well it came it spawned from <f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. <clears throat> and um <sigh>. i we've had this conversation a lot of times. and uh i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again. and why are we having this conversation <laughter>. are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that. that. went into. that um. argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard how do you cope with them [Patient]: um <sigh>. not talking. at all <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um <sigh>. mm. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. because i really don't like. if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. um i was yelled at. a lot. and i just. feel bad about that and i. try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. and result in in yelling [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hmm. that would probably be whether to keep. a pregnancy or not [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yeah. yeah i um. i was just talking about it yesterday actually. and um. oh i was pregnant and. i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married. and but i just. didn't think that i it was the right time for me. and um. i had. pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself. and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant. he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard. because i felt obligated to do so. and felt super guilty to not. and. <drops microphone> oops. and uh. this is on correctly um. hang on this ear piece is falling. there we go. that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no. i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um. the hospital should um unplug the life. or um life support machine for my father. or not. that was the hardest decision [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. and to have been um. to resort to the situation that he was in. not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. for himself um. was beyond it. who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to um resort that [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: not. hardly ever [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: <laughter>. too many things running on my mind um. and pretty much um. mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. uh even though i. know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about. uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time. but um. and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out. but it's hard [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: very stressed [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: mm my son is is um. has been. uh in dealing with some legal issues. and um currently is incarcerated. and uh. it's been really hard [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: yes i've been probably very short. moody irritable [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>. my mind just goes from one. point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there. um you know. it's interesting. uh yeah [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: about three years ago [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um my. um o_b_g. suggested i. i uh. see a psychiatrist [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: well um. i've. in the process of changing therapists so it's been about. because the program that i was in. um. lost funding. and i lost my therapist. or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. about two months. maybe three now. and um but i did notice when i was in therapy. um that it was just an intricate part of my. my life my week to. see my therapist. um. it really helped me. cope [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um. when he was released. from um. jail [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning. that i'll. i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to. do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know. legally of course. um. outgoing. um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her. um. and. compassionate. sensitive. loyal [Interviewer]: mhm what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: mm. all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: well yelling the yelling part was one. um. just <j> just the little things that. used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself. doing them and it bothers me a lot [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: regarding what [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: mm. <clears throat>. um. not too much really i don't know [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <clears throat>. to go to college right after high school. and not wait. um. and <sigh>. that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and. not in a relationship and still be happy and. live life [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: um. what did i do. mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good. yeah [Interviewer]: how

line uh or a little bit better you know [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um. you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever. when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone. sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be. you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it. i kinda close down and shut you know. shut off for a little bit [Interviewer]: mhm when was the last time you argued with someone and

know um i call minor sins. you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: um. let's see i guess. sometimes you know um. you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to. you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but. sometimes i like to like. talk to people i guess. you know [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: well that's a good question. i guess. i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently. i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that. and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like. get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do. you know um. and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way. which is kinda nice. um we have some cats thank you thank you we have

relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think. i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um. that get along with me pretty well actually you know [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby. um the only problem i have. i think. is i feel. like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that. and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens. and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: well right now generally i've been feeling um. worried and and anxious and um. you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today. well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her. but um. you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good. and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too. and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like. and um. a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess [Interviewer]: yeah how do you cope with them [Patient]: well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate. so. um. you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower. all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way. i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just. more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: you know um working towards you know the goals. you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um. you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem. like. <laughter> like i wanna like uh. do any of these like terrible jobs [Interviewer]: mhm that sounds really hard [Patient]: i xxx it's you know it's it's. probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um. you know one of these things is like uh. i feel like um it is hard. but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it. you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it. and like uh you know. it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry [Interviewer]: yeah have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no. no. <grumble> [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: man. <sigh>. uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe. i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like. not even happy about that you know i feel like um. you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that. it just makes me feel good. you know so i i have these these. these times where i'm just you know feeling good. about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and. and uh you know. incredible that you know um it just eh. you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times. you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes. you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know [Interviewer]: uh huh what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes. who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh. i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can. like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know. that if i got my you know diet in check um. you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um. my <m> my. my uh. i guess my my. desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad. and like things are so um rough that. you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like. it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like. to um <laughter>. <sigh> do things [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: the one thing i regret is is not. is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um. you know. not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like. you know just to um. just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like. like uh. i mean there is a this idea of justice and. and um and republicanism. and you know things that i really you know adhere to. that um i fall in love with. and that i don't wanna get away from. but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money. and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that. that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like. like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: ugh <sigh>. i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe. um. you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i. you know regret on one hand on the other hand. you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about. and you know. i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid. i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that. i think that real people have you know. um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i'm pretty happy and content with. being you know the cautious you know. uh. <sigh>. i don't know [Interviewer]: okay how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night. and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family. feel that i don't put a lot of. time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my. time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really. you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different. i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real. you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it. you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they. you know. if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor. i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness. i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like. i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um. you know uh. like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends. but it's the same time i i just feel like it's. it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a. a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know. gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me. and i you know so i just do these things you know just [Interviewer]: mm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know. um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know. i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like. like that proud of myself. for you know those things alone like graduating from college. you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean. um. running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim. so they're like half merits. you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further. but um. you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like. that um i've seal real new no. life <l> lifelong. benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done

mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight. um i couldn't sleep a lot. and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um . felt sad sometimes . like i wanted to cry a lot  [Interviewer]: i'm sorry  how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: i've been feeling okay. um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so. i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get  . out and do more things  [Interviewer]: yeah  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  [Patient]: um . no no it's no no i haven't . not any different from. before what i was experiencing before  [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now  [Patient]: no  [Interviewer]: why did you stop  [Patient]: mm. well mm i was receiving um . uh i guess psychotherapy and um. i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda . got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard  [Patient]: uh sometimes  [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy's useful  [Patient]: i do . yes it is [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  [Patient]: it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something  [Patient]: i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind. that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them  [Patient]: um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps. other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  [Interviewer]: i see  [Patient]: it [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well  [Patient]: tired <laughter> . yeah mostly uh tired um. kinda confused  [Interviewer]: okay  when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um  . last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear all about it  [Patient]: uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me. and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um. that's about it  [Interviewer]: okay  how would your best friend describe you  [Patient]: how would my best friend describe me probably as um . quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious . um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and. they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or. um easy to talk to um. that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  [Interviewer]: aw  that's great  [Patient]: <laughter>  [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: to just . relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people. because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you. are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their . their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just. believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: that makes sense  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  [Patient]: um really enjoyed working with um well . okay. a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball [Interviewer]: awesome  what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: um being the first to attend college in my family. and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so . uh i'm most proud of being able to . have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and. help

young that. weren't the best [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh>. sometimes i feel that i should've. been. more aware. at a younger age

and um. even though logically i know that. it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time. you know as you get older you eh hindsight is twenty twenty as you get older you you look back and wish

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: i am [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: i was born and raised in los angeles. and i'm one of the few locals from around here. and uh i went to school away and uh. but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yes i am [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: i like the weather. having owned a vacation house in another state. that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here. um i like the culture i like the diversity. i like the familiarity. i like that beaches. uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert. but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. and uh i think it's a great place to live [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: well. more of some maybe some of the. things i don't like about l_a or say california in general. say like the high tax rate. which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now. which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations. i'm a small business owner. so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated. and uh that's a big problem here in uh. uh california [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh. also uh. you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't. see that but it's a big tax on the social service system. and that's what makes our taxes. uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: so that's. you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state [Interviewer]: mhm i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries. and uh. i don't travel as much as i used to. but i've traveled quite a bit. and i've learned a couple of languages and uh. i served [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: i'm sorry [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: uh. i didn't really understand uh your question. when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and. i've been all through europe eastern europe. asia. south america. north africa. um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf. 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga. and work out and uh. i try to eat healthy and uh. that's a big part of my life [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: oh. sure. um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span. but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times. we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local. and rented a small flat and. cooked and did our own shopping but really. having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days. it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city. and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french. which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger. my mother insisted that all of us kids. take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh. all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french. with the french. you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: <laughter> so that was a [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: uh. i have a few different degrees. so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate. and uh. that was fun. and i also have a masters. uh degree in economics. and i have a degree in crisis management. so [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: uh i found them um. interesting. and uh. it was something that i wanted to do. where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports. and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland. and i originally wanted to be a doctor but. once you start going to school. for a little bit you change your mind. etcetera so [Interviewer]: mhm are you still working in that [Patient]: um i'm actually in the wholesale business now. for wholesale distributors of furniture products. and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago. well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business. and it's. pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it. but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: hm. actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home. and uh. uh. i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter. and uh [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked. but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids. you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life. so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers. but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable. i think i'm more of an extrovert. whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted. but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation. and be more um. introverted. i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh. one of my i have uh several computers at home. and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well. i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach. you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes. it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years. i had. it uh. i usually find exercise helps me relax the best. or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>. but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yes that was uh. that was it but. that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills. i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years. i think i've gotten better. uh at the [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature. as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and. be a little more. how do you had had the skills earlier [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged. um. you know i. i am more likely to think before i speak now. whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought. so i might've said more things that i. in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or. a work situation. um. but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it. i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: oh wow. you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional. argument um. probably. um. my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter. and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just. basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting. and uh just. uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused. us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument. but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree. butt heads. so [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt like i was talking to a wall. and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've. learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should. usually have but you're not really thinking of that because. sometimes when we're younger we're. looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me. but you know. i'm pretty easy going and i have. different. ideas on raising children how she did. and that was more. not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really. discussed those things but it was really just fundamental. reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: whereas other things looked good. you know on paper to both of us [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hm. there's one recently my father passed away uh recently [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: thank you. and. really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days. and i really only invited very very close friends and family members. i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of. not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a. i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact. that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known. about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but. now as time's passed i wish i'd invited. more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends. you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just. and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because. i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but. i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little. they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that. you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less. doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really. mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so [Interviewer]: i see tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um well both my parents are recently. uh deceased in the last couple of years. and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away. in december. and. we're not super close like i always like i look at other families. we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting. i guess we're also uh different [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and uh. i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that. we just. never did that because we're all. all so uh. uh different [Interviewer]: yeah i understand [Patient]: yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but. you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know. but i think every family has their own sort of. stuff [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from. some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from. you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was. but i think i function. pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years [Interviewer]: why'd you decide to enlist in the military [Patient]: i didn't enlist i was an officer. i went to one of the service academies [Interviewer]: how old were you when you joined the military [Patient]: that. um seventeen i started when after high school. and i went to a service academy. so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into [Interviewer]: you were very young weren't you [Patient]: i was but same age as everybody else that went there [Interviewer]: did you ever see combat [Patient]: uh we did. nineteen eighty three [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just. we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled. at the time. and poison gas was sprayed on us. so [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: that was a. it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh. too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you. you actually play in the game and the same with uh. you know if you're in a combat. unit [Interviewer]: mhm how did serving in the military change you [Patient]: well it made me more patriotic having grown up. in california. whereas people who are from all over the country. and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did. never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i. ended up becoming uh. just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country. whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or. georgia north dakota south dakota montana [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: grows up with that kind of uh. pride so i thought it was good and it. unlike so many of my friends that. they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan [Interviewer]: what did you do after the military [Patient]: uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school. and i got two graduate degrees. and i went to work in private enterprise. uh. didn't care for it. then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic. for a number of years and. then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life [Patient]: um. at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked. and again i was an officer. uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile. to be able to come back to los angeles. uh. because it was just so uh. so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality. so but [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: it was a great experience [Interviewer]: that's good how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um. it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late. and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well. even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um. but i generally sleep uh. i generally sleep pretty well [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i feel pretty good lately. you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but. boy the last few months i feel great pretty much [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: no not really. i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately [Interviewer]: okay have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it. and. you know. it wasn't. anything real too debilitating. and i wasn't able to really function. on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: i do i was really against it in the past. and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh. my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past. i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about. life relationships. and sometimes it's good talking things out with a. a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and. i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off. i do have someone that i go to [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you [Patient]: i think it's nice. you know they really. if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped. they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's. always in the past they just help you talk through your. your thoughts. and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: to the situation that's why i like. talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so but it's. um. i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and. was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: uh this morning. i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and. family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather. and i have a bunch of errands to run. and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out. and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold. where i always i know that term so. but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: and i looked forward to feeling the sun. so [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects. i'm too smart for my own good. and i'm a. i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational. i'm very resourceful. people always call me when they have issues. and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go. whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. you know i'm great with medical diagnoses. uh. and uh. you know people also say i'm a lot of fun [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i'm fun to be with. and um. i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white. i am what i am. i don't b_s. you know. i'm the opposite of a politician. so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so that's pretty much [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: i like to think i do [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: uh. probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy. uh. i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. uh. but just a lot of it's very typical [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive. or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now. i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking. in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um i'm proud of my daughter she's. a nice young lady i am uh. proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my. military service and fire service. um there are very few people like me who did it. who are as. had the background in education that i did but i like public service. and um. so i'm proud of uh that [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]:  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. sort of like trophies. i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and. knock wood maintain good health [Interviewer]: okay i

africa and make an influence [Interviewer]: that's great do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: kind of in between i have my shy moments but then when i'm around a group of people that i enjoy i'm pretty outgoing [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um to relax i normally write or i go to the beach and just sit there play my guitar [Interviewer]: mhm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: pretty good i don't really. get

had handled differently [Patient]: mm. um. well with my ex. i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now. um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um hardest decision i've ever had to make was. man i really don't know actually [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer [Interviewer]: tell me about that [Patient]: um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed. so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: uh me and my family aren't very close we don't. i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close connection <collection> connection <con> connection um. especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from. having been grown up out in. america so it's pretty different when it comes to those cultural <cu> racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each other's feet on. but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but it's okay [Interviewer]: okay what do you think of today's kids [Patient]: i think they are out of control. i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing. and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded. by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow. and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost [Interviewer]: yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um usually creative actually. when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um. stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um lately

'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night  [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because i'm restless  [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something  [Patient]: no. but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily  [Interviewer]: that's good  [Patient]: i pray before i go to sleep. and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray. recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep  [Interviewer]: mm when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: i don't know probably uh . can't have any specific remembrances . of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably. fifteen years ago  [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  [Patient]: well. i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh. made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play. the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a. fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing . you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county. and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a  [Interviewer]: how hard is that  [Patient]: not not hard it was just uh. just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually. missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera    [Interviewer]: wow how would your best friend describe you  [Patient]: i don't have a best friend  [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: uh . i'm uh very bright. i'm a. perfectionist at my job . i'd say that's about it  [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to. two state colleges and two. junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my . you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall  [Interviewer]: yeah that's great  is there anything you regret [Patient]: yeah i regret you know . alienating family members  [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: i would've uh . basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that . you know i could always get another one and not you know. basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now . they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible  [Interviewer]: mhm okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  [Patient]: thank you  [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: hasta luego
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: uh doing okay doing okay [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: uh north carolina [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: when did you move to l_a [Patient]: uh almost four years ago [Interviewer]: wow why did you move to l_a [Patient]: um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: uh probably three <th>. at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: um uh it's. l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and. seeing some friends um but um i i feel more. i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home [Interviewer]: uh huh what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh. i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um. i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be. in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh. uh i'm able to uh pursue. eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um. resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston. so uh it's not the worst but um. uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably. drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but. i can't really change geography [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks what did you study at school [Patient]: uh. <laughter>. <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the. uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could. make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now [Interviewer]: that's great i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: i do um i love traveling i try to uh. go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently. and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you. uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and. knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or. and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to. just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created [Interviewer]: mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh yeah sure i went to uh. barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out. and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks. and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i. mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing. even virtual people. oop. i lost ya [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um to relax i uh. listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to. go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy. cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh. sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh. um uh pretty simple tastes [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: yep. <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie> [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: <laughter>. this is awkward isn't [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can. kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what. i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty. i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like. uh misremembering when uh. something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled. uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like. trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person. thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged. uh i guess in the classical sense of the word [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um <sigh>. i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um. um i just recently did a uh uh a project. like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it. uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was. doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um. uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um. but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let. uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so. just my thoughts there [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: <sigh>. <laughter>. hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>. uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh. ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: break up with her after some stuff happened and. um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to. uh to uh. break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh. uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: ugh just. a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so. uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um. i uh. yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help. but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or. um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very. big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh. uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i. if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um. uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next. um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little. um. uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh. um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of. the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a. group of people or or company um. carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee [Interviewer]: uh huh how do you cope with them [Patient]: how do i cope with. them um. i assume you mean i guess. uh. people i work with how do i cope with the. uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to. how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and. you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the. uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it. then uh it's progress right [Interviewer]: yeah have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh. um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check. throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to. follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel. um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that [Interviewer]: mhm how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling. uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh. and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself. but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms [Patient]: uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all. had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or. cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a. a symptom so um. uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh. um. i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and. i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good. good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly. and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that. uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't. you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um <sigh>. i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh. uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me. and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very. kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child. i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to. um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh. um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of. you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with. uh the man he is [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six. um. uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old. but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where. so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so. i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control. how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so [Interviewer]: right what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i. um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid. depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh. i'm low and uh i treat it as such and. i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i. i have a i'm a i'm a pretty. like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i. mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and. i'm just a smoking gun of. sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh. um i don't i don't lose sight of uh. the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: mm [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um i was on a my uh. my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh. um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and. then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like. lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have. someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh. i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care. uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and. i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them. and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm. probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have [Interviewer]: mhm okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: thanks ellie

year sometimes i go more sometimes less [Interviewer]: mhm how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um. i think that. other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there. are just more my. type and what i'm used to and. it's less superficial [Interviewer]: i understand why did you move to l_a [Patient]: <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: um initially it was easy because i felt like. it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally [Interviewer]: mm what did you study at school [Patient]: uh fine arts and photography [Interviewer]: that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and publishments. so i decided to pursue art [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. scrubbed_entry [Interviewer]: awesome are you happy you did that [Patient]: yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um. i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um i consider myself more shy [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. i. watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and. just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um. i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having. if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger [Interviewer]: uh huh when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like. insignificant things. but other than that. um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: um [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd wanna. like have in my memory [Interviewer]: yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um she was she was a very positive influence and always. was not judgmental. um. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people. they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you. are older [Interviewer]: mhm how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep. no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m. i will be up like clockwork. by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: no i just. in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning [Interviewer]: hmm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring. but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. i don't know i kind of just feel very. mm. like so so. just. no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of. one note land [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: i mean nothing like lately. um. like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and. just reserved and. not very outgoing [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no i have been diagnosed with anxiety [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid [Interviewer]: why did you stop [Patient]: um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day. it wasn't. i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it [Interviewer]: i see what you mean tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. when i'm there i can always just. we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out. just enjoy the day [Interviewer]: that's great is there anything you regret [Patient]: in general [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: um. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and. the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here. so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or. you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. that it was more like a transfer school like you. you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so it kind of create created more problems for me [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <sigh>. well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago. i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home. and to have. really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. my best friend would describe me. as a great charismatic funny outgoing. socially enjoyable person which is different than how. people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak much [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. i'm very caring. i. i'm a very good judge of character. which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself. um. i'm very affectionate <aff>. i mean. i'm not very affectionate i'm more. i mean i guess i guess so [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye [Patient]: thanks

by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: i just think seeing different places it's um. learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest [Interviewer]: mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um. let's see. i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um. being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger. and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh. it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh. i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat [Interviewer]: (laughter what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: too many to mention i i don't even know where to start [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: suppose it depends on the situation [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading. uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh. you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: <sigh>. in the

know how to answer that [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly. cared about but knowing. knowing that it just wasn't going to work um. that was very difficult [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: just weighed pros and cons and just thought. it just wasn't going to work um. no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship. there was something missing. and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and. just knew it was over [Interviewer]: yeah are you happy you did that [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but

about her she uh. uh. she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way [Interviewer]: that's great how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh suppose it depends on my stress level. um. when i have a lot on my mind. i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just. if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep [Interviewer]: mm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: crabby uh i

noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: well um <sigh>. i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to. to step back from certain situations. and not take them so seriously. and not get so tense or angry. and then react. i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: now

young self something. if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know. anything i do in the past. would. this life would be now be a variable so me going

i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that. i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even. but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to. to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you

are you doing today [Patient]: i'm doing very good today [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: i'm originally from chicago illinois. moved out here when i was three [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: i never go back [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: family issues [Interviewer]: i see what you mean how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: it depends on what you're into. if you're into. um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all. um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i'll [Interviewer]: why did you move to l_a [Patient]: my mom and my dad split up [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: <laughter> it's okay [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here [Interviewer]: okay what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: i like the sunshine. i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter. fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood. i like that the lakers are here and. and [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: <laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think. l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a [Interviewer]: yeah what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: oh gang violence [Interviewer]: i understand i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: <laughter>. no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california. and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances [Interviewer]: yeah what did you study at school [Patient]: i studied alcohol and drug counseling [Interviewer]: cool how did you decide to do that [Patient]: i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so. um. that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and. i just went into it. to do it just just to see what it was. and. i finished school and. did a intership and got hired and so. i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: i'm not working right now i actually moved away and. i had to <deep breath>. i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um. in order to make that move. but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: well. it can be it can be very difficult at times because. um. i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly. and but the regular dopes i can. and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours. so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um. yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience. and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard [Interviewer]: mm what's your dream job [Patient]: <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility. um. or or as an author [Interviewer]: cool do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: you know that depends <de>. that depends on on. on people mainly i mainly. adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up. but if people open up right away then i open up right away [Interviewer]: uh huh okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. i i mainly listen to music or. i watch youtube. write poetry. um. or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't. so <laughter> that's [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: and another thing i do is. i eat ice cream <laughter> [Interviewer]: nice how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that. last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was. um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred. i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and. i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and. you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. i just believe that. and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um. heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: well i was just telling you about um. it was it was my mother's husband and. to tell you the truth um. i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped. you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure. as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um. that. i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so. i should've just left. i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um. yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months. so. yeah those six nine months i can't get back [Interviewer]: hmm that sounds really hard [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago. thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother. and um. my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and. how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and. i have family in chicago but. i don't. mess around with that side of the family just just because um. of what i seen. and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance [Interviewer]: mm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: someone who's been a positive influence <inf>. influence in my life i would say. scrubbed_entry. taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else. and. taught taught me how. how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until. that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um. and of course um he's. he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got. twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: feel guilty about. my grandfather. um passed away in two thousand four. and. at that time i was just getting out of prison. um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he. told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer. but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that. plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying. but. when he died. i figured out that he was telling me. that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then. and [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i feel. i think about it all the time [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: something i can erase from my memory. huh. would be the day. my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like. that's one memory i just i can just go without. replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt conflicting feelings. because on one hand [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: on one hand my brother was protecting me. from getting beat. and on the other hand he was hitting my mom. so. was kinda in the middle [Interviewer]: yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh most nights i don't. i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well. i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um. if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep [Interviewer]: i see what you mean how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: how i been feeling lately. i just been feeling like. that. things are about to start going better for me. um making some better decisions. um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people. that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes. i don't care if i get. five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission. and. and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people. um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before. um. the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering [Interviewer]: that's good have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: my behavior i'm more mellow. um i laugh more more humorous. i let a lot of things go that i used to just. let tick me off. and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and. mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally. and psychologically eh. and the um. acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me. so. i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um. my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm. you know um. back then i just tolerated myself now i um. actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you. to feel the same way [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no no i haven't [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: <laughter>. yeah [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it. and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it. and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people. um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them. like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. i wish i would've never. well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um. i wish. that i could change. well. um my economic status my employment status. and um. my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of. stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be. um. confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up. every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says. are they looking at my teeth so i would really. change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be. at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it [Interviewer]: okay what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: twenty years ago which would make me eighteen. i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity. was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i. could've been playing for the lakers last night but. hey [Interviewer]: yeah what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: i'm most proud of the fact that. you know what i'm most proud of my mom. really. really. um. she graduated from school. she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at. five in the morning. go to work. get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week. and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this. you know when they say xxx. that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um. and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so. i'm just real proud of that and um. her life has been affecting people. in a in a positive way so yeah my mom [Interviewer]: that's great okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: <laughter> okay thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes thanks [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm well thank you how are you [Interviewer]: that's good i'm great thanks where are you from originally [Patient]: i grew up in oklahoma [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: when did you move to l_a [Patient]: um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so [Interviewer]: mhm why did you move to l_a [Patient]: um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here [Interviewer]: how do you like your living situation [Patient]: oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice [Interviewer]: awesome what did you study at school [Patient]: mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different. areas and. i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: um. not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: <laughter> um. you know i have actually studied to become a success coach. um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice. aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students. um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that. um. you know it can be challenging for people to actually. be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um. undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it. uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time [Interviewer]: mm okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so that's nice [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm [Interviewer]: let's come back to that later [Patient]: okay i'm sorry <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so [Interviewer]: mhm are they triggered by something [Patient]: no i don't think so. um at least not not that i'm aware of [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: <sniffle>. i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew. and they live on the east coast. and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes [Interviewer]: i understand tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so [Interviewer]: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so [Interviewer]: uh huh what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: it's okay. thank you [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things [Interviewer]: okay what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so [Interviewer]: yeah i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago [Interviewer]: hmm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so [Interviewer]: okay tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too [Interviewer]: nice okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: sure. thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

i'd say uh. people are rude. um. not having enough money. uh what else. mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess. <cough> [Interviewer]: what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: i guess it depends on . what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general [Interviewer]: mhm can you give me an example of that [Patient]: uh. if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: is that what you're talking about [Interviewer]: okay yes [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about

[Patient]: um. well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought. that would uh. be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy's useful [Patient]: oh yeah definitely [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: <clears throat>. thanks [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you  [Patient]: um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff. like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think [Interviewer]: i see what you mean what are some things that usually put you in a

back now with what i know now i probably would not have made [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible [Interviewer]: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: hmm. scrubbed_entry. he's always good for a. sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective [Interviewer]: that's good how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. talented. and. i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny [Interviewer]: mhm okay thanks for sharing your thoughts with me okay i think i've asked everything i need to goodbye [Patient]: see you later
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: <sniffle>. <sniffle>. yes [Interviewer]: okay okay so how are you doing today so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good [Interviewer]: that's good that's good where are you from originally where are you from originally [Patient]: i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there. and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county. about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so [Interviewer]: cool cool [Patient]: it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: some things that that i really like i would have to say you know. the beach. um you know. not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um. definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know. just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean [Patient]: right. yep [Interviewer]: i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot. i've been to places like hawaii. been to the caribbean. i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth>. um you know just different places like. arizona i've been to oregon washington. pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so [Interviewer]: mhm mhm [Patient]: yep <clears throat> [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture. um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery. it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say. something that you know people haven't seen before so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time. new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands. we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu. uh maui you know places like that so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um you know i would have to say that. um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor. just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: mhm what did you study at school what did you study at school [Patient]: yeah. i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester. so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that's great that's great [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college. and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting. but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me. so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but. you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know. kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories [Interviewer]: yeah yeah [Patient]: i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job [Patient]: <laughter>. my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting. sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine. so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still. like i said i'm twenty three years old. um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but. for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so. things are uh you know. getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that's good that's good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back. other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but. you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before. so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know. i can either be talk very talkative. or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. um you know usually um. i would listen to music. or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive. or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know. ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy. so [Interviewer]: mm mm [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: you know i've actually been better with that. um couple years back you know i. there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just. pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but. you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing. and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat> [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but. you know it's it's always something so miniscule that. that's why i probably don't remember it. but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that. you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: <clears throat>. yeah [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: something that i feel guilty about. um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing. but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent. kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got. diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough. and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies. he could be a little you know. crazy. so. probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back. been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to. i don't i don't  you know. try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: okay okay how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: my best friend. <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy. usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too. um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny. um i like to hang out you know just. kinda. do things here and there you know just. normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: <clears throat [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep. i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know. my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough. so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part. i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat> [Interviewer]: okay okay how have you been feeling lately how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: lately eh. been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up. i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago. for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that. um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good. and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but. you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: i have not. no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: nope [Interviewer]: do you feel down [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still. still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave. so you know we were just hanging out. um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt great you know it. because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything. can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like. that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so. yeah [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret. um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about. three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time. you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances. that took place. so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it. but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said. it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: yeah yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <laughter>. well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if. i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just. be careful you know. make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be. um. basically you know just always be nice be honest. um just be caring toward others so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing. i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so. <clears throat>. yeah [Interviewer]: okay okay tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends. um either you know we hang out in the day. you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers. um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: some things that i wish i could change. um. probably just you know be nicer like i said before. um. maybe not being as lazy have more determination. i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life. but i know there are times when i i kinda. get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: um well you know it's it's tough to think back. but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know. i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have. i was trying to give more constructive criticism but. at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and. they were out of character so. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: okay what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined. i'm very caring now. more than i used to be. very honest. and you know i i just i love to talk to people. like i like making new relationships. i like making people laugh <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that's good that's good tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: <clears throat>. something that i did recently that i really enjoyed. um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two. and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so. i feel accomplished about that. you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that. so [Interviewer]: awesome awesome [Patient]: makes me feel good yep. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: what was it about what was it about [Patient]: um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just. usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah. <clears throat>

saint thomas barbados saint lucia. um. saint martin. and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. i think <sigh> going to mexico the last time i was there. i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see. the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh i consider myself more shy [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable. um i'm not one to just. go up to people and start conversations. um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just. kind of out of place at a party [Interviewer]: i see what you mean what did you study at school [Patient]: um i actually studied history [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um i've always been interested in history. and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course u_s history. so i'm very into uh history [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: um i'm actually working in uh the education field [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel <laughter> that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do. doing. um. so i would love to do that as a job [Interviewer]: mhm sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter>. um i love reading. and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath. and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh. deal with stress and. it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising [Interviewer]: that's great how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um. i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily. and sometimes as an adult i still get angry. easily but i've gotten a lot better at. trying to think about things first before saying them and. not having outbursts. things like that [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend. and she actually she has kids i don't. and for some reason she thought. or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and. she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things. um i don't think i've ever made her feel that. i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um. well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because. when she was talking to me she was very upset and. i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her. but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling. match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and. maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument [Interviewer]: hmm how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation. i felt that maybe i could've just let her. let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly. um instead of yelling at her too [Interviewer]: i see what you mean tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: oh wow um. that's a tough one i think um. gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years. um. although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was. kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and. i kinda felt by ending the relationship um. i would've wasted those last seven years of my life. it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did. because then i went on to meet um. my husband [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um well about i would say. maybe. fifteen years ago i was. hanging out with a couple of friends at a. club. and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place. and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it. but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them. and. back at their house um. one of the guys. actually pulled me into a room and. tried. i i got scared i yelled. he tried to choke me and i thought. i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me. but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left. so. it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard [Patient]: it was [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother. um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older. and we get along pretty well. um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever. and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents. um my dad. still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um <sigh> i usually wake up. a few times throughout the night. um. so. i think it's rare for me to sleep. uh the whole night through ever. um and i do feel a little. like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely. um. so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um i don't know it. i have a hard time falling asleep. and then sometimes i have bad dreams or. i need to get up to use the restroom um. but yeah it. i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. emotionally good. um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice. um. physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda. makes me feel. bad um 'cause i like working out. um but health wise i'm good <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. it was. last <la> this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband. we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but. we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and. went to the beach and just had a really good time [Interviewer]: nice how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um she would probably describe me as a good caring person. um. patient. very shy. um. she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people. um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: i wish i was more outgoing. um. i wish that. i. what else. definitely more outgoing. um. so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy. um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience. and um i wish i could. find a better job so i could do more traveling [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree. and i really wish that i could've. you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did. um. and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that. going out and hanging out and just. you know. and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um i'm proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to. go to u_c_l_a and get my degree. um. yeah that would be my proudest achievement [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]:

fast. and that that may have been [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: well <sigh>. a situation that i wish i would've handled differently. there's so many <laughter>. uh. i guess when i was still with my ex-wife. in florida. i wish i wouldn't have. gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions. she had a tendency to. get underneath my skin. and uh you know. keep picking at me until. i exploded. and. i allowed her to do that. you know i i should've just. walked away when i could. and um you know not let my temper get the best of me [Interviewer]: okay have you ever served in the military [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh sometimes it's hard. um. sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through. with work and you know. making sure. you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent. you know wondering what my kids are going through. you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore. if they even know they have a father. you know. those are some of the things that run through my head and. and that keeps me up at night sometimes [Interviewer]: do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself [Patient]: a little <sigh> but <sigh>. you know i put myself in this situation so. you know i i gotta. bear with it you know i gotta. you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh>. i gotta deal with it in my own way [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: lately. um. i've been trying to. not think so much about. you know all that's going into my life. uh i try to distract myself. and that kind of. gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or. just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know. all the stresses in my life. um [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: the last time i felt really happy. uh. was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um. with a couple of my friends from work and um. i don't know. we just got. pretty drunk and just <laughter>. that kinda helped me to forget. all the crap that was. previously going through my head. so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that. other stuff. then i'm happy <sigh> [Interviewer]: uh huh what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter>. um. uh i'm kind of like a. i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends. you know. i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting. or i may. um you know just listen to people so you know eh. i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something. troubling times like like i'm going through [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: scrubbed_entry. uh who lives in florida. you know i talk to him every now and then and. he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and. you know i just kind of. talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to. you know when i was living in florida. i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me. and now that i'm here in l_a. i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so. he um. he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice. you know about what i think you know he should do. um. so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that. uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff [Interviewer]: yeah that's great what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: <laughter>. i don't know <sigh> um. sometimes i wish i wasn't so. kind or generous. it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me. and i may not realize it. and um. i don't like saying no to people i like. to always please people. so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it. you know. help others and not you know. that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to. pay bills but. i feel better helping people. i don't know [Interviewer]: yeah is there anything you regret [Patient]: i regret. not. breaking up with my ex-wife sooner. i regret <re> i regret <re> [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because she put me through so much crap in my life. and um. i was always trying to. be a people pleaser i was trying to please her. you know trying to. please my kids as much as i can. by not breaking up you know the family. but. you know there's only so much one person can take. and i i think probably if i would've left sooner. i may have been happier. and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did. you know. during all those years with her. so. maybe if i would've got out sooner. i don't know i would've been happier i guess [Interviewer]: i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. it's okay to be selfish. it's okay to. you know. think about yourself sometimes. you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you. then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy. and even though. pleasing people may make you happy. uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs. because. you know. you play an important role. in. the lives of your close family members. and um. in order to keep everything afloat. you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's. you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so. be a little selfish sometimes it's okay [Interviewer]: right tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: <laughter>. i don't even know what a weekend is anymore. my ideal weekend would be. locked away alone in my room. watching movies listening to music just. with my. cell phone off and. not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar. you know or you know watching a a metal show. so. i like to be alone. but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people [Interviewer]: uh huh how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: crazy <laughter>. he thinks i'm uh. i'm crazy for coming out here. but. i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded. and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter. how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out. so. i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight. but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm. crazy but. strong-minded <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: my kids <sigh>. you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy. are my kids and. you know just having them in my life is is the. proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them. in my life. and although i don't get to see them as much. even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know. how far they've gone. you know. what what they've accomplished in their you know. in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy. and i can't wait to see them again [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: one

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm okay um. i'm a little. pensive i guess a little. uh down but. more or less okay [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that where are you from originally [Patient]: i was born in annapolis maryland [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: on the east coast [Interviewer]: why did you move to l_a [Patient]: originally i moved because i went to film school um. and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um. but living. l_a is very has a very different kind of. um. attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i. but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: uh not at all um. when i left things got things were sort of i. i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um. to be with. uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of. i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess [Interviewer]: mhm when was the last time that happened [Patient]: um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed [Interviewer]: cool what was it about [Patient]: um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing [Interviewer]: mm what made you decide to do that [Patient]: well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me [Interviewer]: uh huh how hard is that [Patient]: it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough [Interviewer]: hmm could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: things being how they were [Interviewer]: do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself [Patient]: i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard [Patient]: well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better [Interviewer]: that's good how do you cope with them [Patient]: um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now [Interviewer]: mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad [Interviewer]: okay how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now [Interviewer]: yeah what got you to seek help [Patient]: um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough [Interviewer]: okay do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: and then there's you <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter yeah [Patient]: right [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge [Interviewer]: yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so [Interviewer]: uh huh what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world [Interviewer]: mhm that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that [Patient]: oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah [Interviewer]: awesome tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know

oklahoma city  [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter> [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter>  [Interviewer]: why'd you move to l_a [Patient]: um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   [Interviewer]: what'd you study at school  [Patient]: i studied psychology and minored in art  [Interviewer]: are you still working in that  [Patient]: um no not at the moment  [Interviewer]: what do you do now [Patient]: um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  [Interviewer]: what's your dream job  [Patient]: my dream job oh . i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um. i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter> [Interviewer]: what do you do to relax  [Patient]: to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad  [Patient]: things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people. um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>  [Interviewer]: what do you do when you're annoyed  [Patient]: when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but. i try to just. like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything  [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper  [Patient]: um. it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like. like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it  [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  [Patient]: <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone. it was probably with my parents um. i've been having some some car trouble lately and. i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that. i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues  [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family  [Patient]: i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  [Patient]: oh definitely i mean. my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just . she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: oh. probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda. um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter> [Interviewer]: do you travel a lot [Patient]: yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go. travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling  [Patient]: uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um. because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's. all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the. diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  [Interviewer]: have you ever served in the military  [Patient]: no i have not served in the military <laughter>  [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: nope [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression  [Patient]: no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've. i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah   [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep  [Patient]: lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep. or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me   [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well  [Patient]: i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function  [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: i've been feeling really good um . over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and. that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through. a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and. so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  [Patient]: um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more . positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and. of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to. kind of. just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more. confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>    [Interviewer]: when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um . i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and. it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and. um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just. like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>  [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you  [Patient]: my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and. bold and fearless um. that i'm unique. and artistic. and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>  [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: um . probably. just like. the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very. exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and. i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and. i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles  [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret  [Patient]: oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so. i wouldn't really change anything  [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: oh <sigh>. i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i . should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because. um. i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just. tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do  [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  [Patient]: oh . let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> . um oh i guess. i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since. i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so. um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  [Interviewer]: okay i think i've asked everything i need to [Patient]: cool [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  [Patient]: you're welcome  [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: uh okay. <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: los angeles [Interviewer]: really what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: the weather. um. the variety of um environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: um i don't like the superficiality of people. um the narcissistic attitude um. uh just. the um. uh it it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where. you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively. so [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um i have um a fear of flying and i have um i've developed agoraphobia [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: uh incredibly difficult [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um. it's um. eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um. uh what's the word um. immobilizing and and very um distressing actually [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: mhm <laughter> yes it is [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: how to i cope with that um. just uh. just trying to um uh. do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps. um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um. and i try to inform myself um of the um. of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: um yes definitely [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: um. uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces. um. being in a car traveling um. uh being away from home um being in someone else's car. uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control [Interviewer]: okay what did you study at school [Patient]: um. uh xxx actually i i don't go to school right now [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um my dream job is. to be a psychologist <laughter> [Interviewer]: awesome what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um. uh. having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas. um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of. um. uh. i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and. um the betterment of of uh of those things um. bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um. uh. so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um. i think i'm someone who's. um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um. but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that. i think at heart i'm shy. um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges [Interviewer]: okay yeah when was the last time that happened [Patient]: uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: if <i> if i think i'm understanding your question correctly [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: oh no no eh i think i'm misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just i'm um continuously interacting with people. take taking those risks [Interviewer]: okay i see what you mean how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh very good um. mm. very good <laughter> [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. when was the last time i argued with somebody. i actually can't remember it wasn't recent <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think um. uh i'm drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um. from when i was like twenty one <laughter> right now. i can't think of anything contemporary right right now. my mind is [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: okay uh when i was younger [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yes um i lost um. a relationship with my aunt. and my uncle and my cousins. um 'cause when i was twenty one i'm forty five. um. i um. uh. uh. had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical. of her and. um she threw me out of their home. and um. uh. let me back uh i apologized immediately. and they let me back into their lives. um and changed their minds um so. i regret that [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again. and to leave um. uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well that that was my family that was um. the the good side of my family there's um uh. uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family [Patient]: um i don't have any relationship with my family at all. like the. since i was um. uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um. uh. disowned me i guess is the right word. estranged yeah [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second. um something i could um erase um. <laughter> i can't even get it to my memory. um. uh as an example um. uh. i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory [Interviewer]: can you tell me more about that [Patient]: yeah um. i was injured in um the emergency room. scrubbed_entry. doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um. by a doctor um i had collapsed and. i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um. uh what do you call it um. uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um. r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy. and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure. and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake. um. eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis. and so um every time i think about. the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled. um. for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um. uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: and. and it i have residual um. physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um. severe disability <disabil> disability limited um. um. functionality uh with my right my. i'm right-handed uh with my right hand. and arm [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: i don't even know what that is. um. i. you know i i really. i apologize 'cause i can't really probably give you the. uh most suitable answer um. uh. i'm guessing it had something to do with um . my cat um and her um. her xxx urgent uh. um. uh what do you call it. um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that. um. but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether. scrubbed_entry. um and uh i was admitted um to that program. or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um. and i had to pick a life direction but uh that's not a traumatic situation um. so i i don't know how best to answer your question [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i can't [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um i have um. severe nightmares <laughter> and i have um nocturnal um . uh panic attacks [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain [Interviewer]: do you have disturbing thoughts [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yes uh they're triggered by the injury that i told you. um they're triggered by my family. um. they've <th> how they've treated me what um they've said to me what they've done to me um. they're triggered by um. what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical. um illness as well um. so yes [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. i feel very ill. and. feel so fatigued [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: very ill and very fatigued [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: um. when i don't sleep and get enough sleep um uh my anxiety level i believe is up and. um i'm susceptible to feeling distressed. um. so yeah [Interviewer]: i see have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: um three years ago um my <m> my most recent um diagnosis. and in two thousand and one as well [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: um. three years ago and um. when i was um. twenty years old [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um the my background my childhood um. from my family of origin um. and their um uh. uh you know the abuse that i um went through. uh and their ultimate um uh. uh what's the word um. rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: um. no i stopped six months ago [Interviewer]: why did you stop [Patient]: <sigh> um. why did i stop um i'm just taking a break <laughter> i'm gonna continue [Interviewer]: okay do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: yes very much [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you [Patient]: it's helped tremendously [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: um. i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um. um. it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um. um. uh feeling connected. um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to. um give myself a voice and um. um. uh it helps to to do <d> to uh. it <i> it's part of that process. um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself. um. and eh there's just so many benefits it's. i. i'll stop right there there's many more [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. the last time i felt really happy. it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness. um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that <laughter> [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yes um. i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um. um in terms of um. uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at it's best um. uh career relationships um. personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um. as well um i was very active and and doing. uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um. uh just in the in <i> in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished. at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety. um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia. my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um. uh. what else um. um. my insecurity uh as far as um. uh. just um. with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um. that i don't do something that that um. hold on one second. i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them. um. or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um. it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself. um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial. uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel. um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um. i wish i didn't feel um. uh so um. uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um. my family um of not having one. um. and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical. um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and i also wish that um. and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um. uh. the the symptomology. of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um. affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely. um and i i wish i was more articulate. and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken. and someone who is well-written. um but there's many there's many more um. uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself. so many more [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <sigh> um. i'm not sure uh. <sniffle>. maybe to um not be so trusting um. i trusted um. i trusted some medical professionals that um. you know again created the injury. and um. you know were. there's a uh. what's the word. there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just. blindly trust um the medical profession um and. <sniffle> um. don't ask questions and just sort of um. you know. and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition. um and so i would. i would've told myself to be a little more careful um. i guess if that's. useful to your question [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: um what did i really enjoy um. you know i can't think of anything specific um. but um. i know it would have to do um. with either reading or um. connecting with someone on a meaningful level [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: i'm most proud of um. my compassion. um. my um my uh empathy and caring about people. um. despite um i mean i'm proud of it. anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a. um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um. i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career. accomplishments. um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed. um <sniffle> and uh. you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um. the injury. uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness. um. so i i think that would be it. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: you're welcome [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

about traveling [Patient]: uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences. and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between. uh all types of people. it's a very rich experience [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um. which one. to where [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: uh i. guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there. uh as i go. the people and the. warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue. through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: there are so many there really are. but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque. which was just really pure and it. really stayed with me how similar. we actually all are. um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips. uh there. and. let's see. just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too [Interviewer]: nice what did you study at school [Patient]: wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um. entertainment i've studied communications i've studied. whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter> [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy. keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive. and um just allows me to be able to. be fully developed as a human being being able to do that [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um. i don't have a dream job. per se. what i do have is a um. desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose. on a daily basis so [Interviewer]: mm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh probably more outgoing. mhm [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform. before i move uh around i get exercise. so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving. and uh then move forward from there [Interviewer]: that's great how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: argued. um. cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument. um. don't know what it's about. i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: situation i wish i had handled differently. you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets. to hold guilt about the way anything. uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences. uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as. needing them to be different i need to learn from them. or to um just really accept what is [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hardest decision i've ever had to make. um. don't really have a quote on quote hard. decision you know because i grew up in a way. uh where my mother was extremely. wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life. and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say. it's your life. and so. um for me decisions don't really come. as difficult to make. they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood. so i don't really have a. most difficult. decision i've ever made [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: mm. event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to. erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase [Interviewer]: i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out [Interviewer]: that's good how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh. great uh a little more. uh. physical exertion than normal . but uh still great. <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to. the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty. even tempered [Interviewer]: mhm have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: mm. no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: uh that's pretty much every day. <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful. for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: uh. very smart uh. very loving uh very intelligent. funny. uh outgoing. that's probably probably what my friends would say [Interviewer]: uh huh what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: uh there's really nothing that i think i need. <laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself. like i'm okay with everything the way it is. really am. <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago. to know. um. to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago. was important in terms of developing the person that i am now. and. so to just. be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to. learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: recently really enjoyed. uh. uh cooked a very wonderful meal. um 'cause i love cooking. so that was something i really enjoyed [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: wow my my willingness to get to know myself. through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application. of everything that i've learned about people cultures. places and most importantly. you know. the god within me [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye [Patient]: bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you [Interviewer]: that's good i'm great thanks where are you from originally [Patient]: uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um. the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um. camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like. eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that. that i i i would say i like that too [Interviewer]: cool what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath>. uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um. and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know. that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but. that's fine [Interviewer]: uh huh i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job [Patient]: wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>. i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow. make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but. that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if. if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things. and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be. eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um. i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also. fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last. trip i i. took um. lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um. well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um. austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um. like. tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life. i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and. so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my. my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to. traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and. it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it [Interviewer]: awesome sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so. i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like. familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um. maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh. like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that. uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really. relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and. i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax [Interviewer]: uh huh how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so. i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um. yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't. i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>. i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about. things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict. as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um. really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't. sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um. i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um. i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not. even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or. running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait. waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true [Interviewer]: i see what you mean tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um <sigh> hmm. um nothing immediately comes to mind i. well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh. was um. driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow. rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like. reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but. it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they. you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um. <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh. i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up. 'til one or two every night uh and. it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were. more um. able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to. going to sleep later and waking up later [Interviewer]: yeah how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um. you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh. um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um. everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>. in my life uh yeah like i said i. i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i. there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh. i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we. we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: i would say that um <sigh>. it's important to. to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um. recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from. the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um. kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which. eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um. that approach it's kinda fatalistic. and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that. it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of. you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place [Interviewer]: mm that makes sense tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: um <sigh>. well i <sigh>. i i guess when people i i don't especially um. take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that. so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is. uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized. i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody. just out of uh college you know um. went over what we had done and. you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and. i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh. it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um. i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh. not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of. you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that. the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but. you know it wasn't our call <sigh> [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: mm most memorable experiences um. well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um. the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um. for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest. period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i. i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um. and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun [Interviewer]: nice tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty. happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been. very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so. yeah [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: yeah thank you <laughter> [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um. sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh. you know um. helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh>. intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: i. what else i think that um my best friend might say that. uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i. also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: mm. uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um. hmm <tisk>. well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that. um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um. my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh. i'd say maybe the fact that. it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that [Interviewer]: mhm okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: no problem

me to the e_r. and from the e_r i had the choice to. i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i. decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. <exhale> it was awful. it was in chicago and um. it was scary. i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just. start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was. mostly men and um they were all really old. and. it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter>. so that was pretty scary and i just um. it was really hard for me <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah what made you decide to do that [Patient]: i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies. about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work. i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and. i wasn't talking to any of my friends and. i was. drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and. i was just in a really bad place. and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: it was [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um. i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager. and i tried to kill myself then. and i um got put in therapy for quite some time. so. i figured i don't want to go down. that bad path again. i just wanna get better. so i had to do it i had to get help [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: i do i go once a week [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: i feel like if you have the right

<laughter> [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: not that easy at all [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um. ever since <yawn>. i got out of the hospital and start. and i began medication for my depression. i um. just haven't been able to sleep well. falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard. have really. crazy vivid dreams. that wake me up and are disturbing [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: um. i guess just. sometimes they reflect. things that i'm worried about. or happening in my life but they're just. they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen. and it's usually no you dreamed that. sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: probably <laughter> like two nights ago [Interviewer]: wow tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: that is a. hard question. i think. in november <yawn>. after i got out of the hospital. i finally had one good day. and my friend took me into. downtown chicago. and we went to the sears tower. and got to look. over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <laughter> um

of what it takes to really manage your own business and um. and then economics is just to. just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and. start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]:

when i do get angry here and there. i uh. it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay. angry and hold grudges just 'cause. there's no need to life's too short for all that [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody. i have no idea [Interviewer]: (laughter okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: probably when my uh. my brother and my girlfriend got in a little. little argument. uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um. i wish i would've just handled it. right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and. told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution. but now it's just. awkward [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: yeah it does [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision i've ever had to make. man that's a toughy. i don't think i've had too many. tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um. maybe. not moving to colorado

mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh. it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult. mm [Interviewer]: mhm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: my girlfriend's family uh. they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction. just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about. really thinking long term. and uh just seeing them <th> them and. what their family does and. how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to. and they've been very successful they own their own uh. accounting practice and. seeing that influenced me to

of uh economic difficulties and the. the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really. annoyed by our government <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean i'm sure you can tell by my

bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: oh just <sigh>. it um. it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here. um it's exciting and it makes me feel like. um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that. you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day [Interviewer]: mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: well um. one of my trips i went uh. i went to. singapore and then to thailand. and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um. he had <ha> he was uh. uh. a sales engineer. or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing. but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: we went to um. phuket it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter> [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter> [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: mm [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yeah. i'm happy [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing [Interviewer]: uh huh how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: but like she never she never confronted me [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't [Interviewer]: yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: well thanks <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep [Interviewer]: i see [Patient]: but i do [Interviewer]: do you feel down do you feel down [Patient]: <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in [Interviewer]: okay are they triggered by something [Patient]: uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: you know there's little fun things like that [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure [Interviewer]: i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: thanks [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: mm k [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: thanks [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm doing pretty good [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: i was born and raised right here in los angeles [Interviewer]: really what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: <sigh> um the weather. um. would be number one i also like the diverse uh. cultures. i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do. and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids. and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school. um learn about different people [Interviewer]: yeah what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: the traffic the cost of living. um. sometimes i think it's too big. and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or. you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation [Interviewer]: i see what you mean i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years. so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere [Interviewer]: that's good what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been. and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city. you know things like that [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year. um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about. three <thr> i think three to four days. and i got to see the capitol. um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house. the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings. and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy. but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes. but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back [Interviewer]: nice what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii. um. actually maui. that was actually two three three years ago three years ago. in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and. i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day [Interviewer]: tell me about your kids [Patient]: um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins. boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight. they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but. five years apart technically. and they're just super super. typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty. um they're teenage years. um my youngest. um. still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old. so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well [Interviewer]: what's the best thing about being a parent [Patient]: just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how. just with love and nurturing and um. the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with. you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into. you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages. and seeing how they have developed and you know. seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years. and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back [Interviewer]: aw that's so good to hear what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: um. mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say. um. for me being a single parent is um the financial. um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing. um. you know the. just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the. uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself. you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice. uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges. um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and. you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with [Interviewer]: yeah how do you cope with them [Patient]: well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um. i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and. pray a lot and meditate. um. if i see i need a little help if if. you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or. you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just. trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably [Interviewer]: mhm what did you study at school [Patient]: um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology. and now i'm studying business <laughter> [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: i just thought that you know um. there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs. and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better. um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um. with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um. are kinda. become. you know harder to obtain. so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic. and um. you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately. would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations. um trying different foods out um writing about different people. cultures um. learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the. you know the the people there and um. being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um. it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area. if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that [Interviewer]: mhm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy. and um not so much shy as i am reserved now. um. but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm. checking everything everybody else out. and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people. but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk. um you know. i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can. attach myself to one or two people and. you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person [Interviewer]: mhm sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. um. for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging. everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments. meditating. praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. um. if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage. maybe get a facial. um. you know things that will. i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension. um. and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or. i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach. i like <li> also like to just maybe. go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or. maybe go window shopping you know things like that [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper. as i am i just i'm more impatient. unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations. so i just can become really irritated or irritable. um. quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just. lose patience um outside of that. i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and. be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is. like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be. i do try to be patient and understanding. 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone. um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse. so i am conscious of it i try to be. aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and. just lose it [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um <sigh>. well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say. because it was not a personal. contact. but a company i eh we. it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the. response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth. very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her. so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know. i just kinda like reached my boiling point. to say the least and was really upset and. eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument. but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two [Interviewer]: i see tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express. um. or actually it was on sunday yeah and um. i know. the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation. and it not be resolved it just takes you there so. um. just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um. and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact. and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised. <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that. just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know. go back and. pull from those and. you know do my own sense of feedback and. see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and. and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: <sigh>. mm. well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two. and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um. it just was not a good time. and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. and um i wasn't comfortable. with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but. he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy. and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about. that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again. i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been. probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um. being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no. mm mm [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um okay you know um. i was laid off in december. so i've been constantly. trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet. so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges. and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off. you know in the same place. um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating. in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently. although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: well. i'm really good with um people i communicate well. i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um. although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person. um. i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so. if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing. um. but probably like interior decorating. anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays. um. i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so. um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening. i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot. and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um. i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has. to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents. um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces. but um i'm i'm. really good with people just you know period. you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well [Interviewer]: uh huh is there anything you regret [Patient]: mm not really. some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner. um. and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um. a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but. i'm just saying overall i think um had i. yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and. i think that's. that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and. stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: mm. um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just. with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i. face things you know um. i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend. um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: great thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye bye
[Interviewer]: [sync] hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  are you okay with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: quite well. feel good [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: los angeles california here [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: mhm. one of the few. um native born los angelinos [Interviewer]: [laughter] yeah what do you do now [Patient]: i uh. home school my ten year old son and uh. i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: do you travel a lot [Patient]: so that's a full time job huh [Interviewer]: do you travel a lot [Patient]: uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um. for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and. it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine. which is near the uh. galilee. and in a place called uh uh. i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but. uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um. a house for that welcomes. um christian uh. pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the . it's totally ancient but um. most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um. live [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: no. not at all [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: just don't. i you know all my life i've always been. open and and uh willing to socialize and. i remember my younger brother always. um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody. just because i enjoy learning about other people [Interviewer]: that's good what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family. um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then. um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband. and just relax that's what we do and you know. 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so. i like to watch crime dramas [Interviewer]: nice what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: um. really mad probably not a lot um. i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room. almost ever. so that that gets me angry but um. in terms of like really um. getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like. little things that my children do to you know. especially my oldest child who's twenty one. you know he can be confrontational so. other than that nothing gets me like really angry. haven't i haven't haven't felt that [Interviewer]: okay what's the best thing about being a parent [Patient]: um contributing to society helping uh. helping. to raise um responsible people i guess um. and of course the love and the affection and the um. the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go. i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children. are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults. so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and. all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh. challenging discussions and that sort of thing. so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and. you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff [Interviewer]: uh huh what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven. um. you're never not a parent. you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first. with my first child um. thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot. um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but. i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and. um. it it it uh. in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom [Interviewer]: i see what you mean there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there [Patient]: mhm. always [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life [Patient]: i'm sorry. i didn't get what you said [Interviewer]: what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  [Patient]: um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church. um and my faith. uh but also my husband he's been a really um. he's kind of he's very. like logical thinking and very you know grounded. so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always. we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out. it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper. um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like. rarely do i have outbursts um. i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up. so with you know like my husband and i don't. rarely fight like have. arguments that are. yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens. because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something. i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he. um. you know he thinks he knows everything. he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality . and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and. you know as life goes on he'll learn more. he's very confident and very self uh. self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct. and. he still has a lot of learning to do that's all [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: mhm. it is it can be mhm [Interviewer]: what do you think of today's kids [Patient]: i think um. that many of them are um. spoiled and live in an environment of uh. of instant gratification. um. which i think is gonna be. um detrimental to the to the future of this country. but um. you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i. i have um hope that um. they will. i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics. and uh. hopefully our our the next generation and the. the generations after that. can maintain that um. that standard of living i don't know if it's possible [Interviewer]: yeah how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: mm as. loving nurturing um. funny. we laugh a lot and um. caring honest. things that uh. i mean my best i have . well actually my best friend is. it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um. we. i. for some years. took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close. have a very close relationship with them still do. and so um i'm considered the fourth sister. so i would say that those are my best friends and and um. we love each other very much. it's a good relationship [Interviewer]: aw have you ever served in the military [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes. most [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: mostly. mm minorly depression it was more anxiety. um probably um. um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally. like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um. other than that i i you know so. depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. um but now it's under control so. i have a great [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: huh [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic. um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance  [Interviewer]: oh [Patient]: in my brain [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um. we had a . good family gatherings. a little stressed because um. we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um. and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of. some renovation and some. to help and some obviously moving around. and so we're in the throws of that and um. so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because. really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties. so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them [Interviewer]: i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um. not easy usually. all of my life i think i've always. i mean i'm not i've always had um. at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um. to go to the bathroom basically [Interviewer]: oh [Patient]: and uh. other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning. then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then. go back to bed and. go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are. have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: yeah sometimes it does [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: mm. probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know. but um. i think overall probably the same. my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know. they may pitch in a little bit more [Interviewer]: uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: uh not really. not not no. not really. not anything significant [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: huh [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: um actually yes i do. i do feel like therapy is useful [Interviewer]: tell me more about that [Patient]: um well uh we had a situation with my daughter. um. she also suffers from anxiety and. um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish. a group with her that was a six month um. uh. group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a . it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. and um. it's been really good it's been. very helpful it's just all about. how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental. um strategies to keep your uh keep you from. your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know. in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so. um. that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter. and it's been really um. really informational and really helpful i think [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear what got you to seek help [Patient]: oh my daughter was um she was. in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and. we knew it and um. we acted on it that's all [Interviewer]: that's great when was the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. like. really joyful and happy i would say probably. when. probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]:  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful. um and it was it happened that our anniversary was. we left on our anniversary day flew to israel. so it was right at the same time. it was beautiful [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: very meaningful. and other than that i would say you know like. uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and. you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three. on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so [Interviewer]: what are some things that usually put you in a good mood [Patient]: um. um that's an interesting question i would say. um. once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm. have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or. errands to run once i get them done. i feel like a sense of accomplishment. you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um. you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things. you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know. so i think that would be you know for me the most um. most recent. um. way of feeling good and feeling you know. like feeling accomplished [Interviewer]: mhm what's your dream job [Patient]: dream job hm. i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula. and um [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yeah and um. so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends. and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in. the birth the bringing of new life into this world so. i would say that's probably. was my was a dream job and i didn't know it. i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um. was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore. actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed. but um. i like i said i do it for family members [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children. and um. i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends. and. her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave. i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth. which is a whole different experience. so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you. even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like. so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood. um about fifteen years ago. 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old. so um. yeah. and i've been [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um. well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but. uh and you know also like. for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business. and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me. so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the. um. the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby. i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter] . it was in the middle of the night she was like  [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter]. so um [Interviewer]: [laughter] [Patient]: it went really fast but other than that. you know um. yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. in all of life or in your job [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: uh probably my my own birth. i mean my the birth of my own children [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. like there's an extreme. sense of joy excitement relief. because of course you're out of the pain. and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know. going forward from there but it's. it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome. after you give birth [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: and i have experienced both ways i've done both um. natural and. my last child was via c_section so i've had both. both um experiences [Interviewer]: mhm is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little. psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny [Interviewer]: [laughter] [Patient]: and um she. she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was. born very quickly after he broke the water and oof. my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble. because i only had like two contractions after that [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: my daughter was born in the bed. so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but. um i'm sure they weren't happy. to fill out a lot of paper work after that [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago. um. ten or twenty years ago i was probably more. not as um. relaxed not as um. like i feel now at my age that um. i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about. uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what. you know. you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care. you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever. so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that. you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: what are you most proud of in your life. most proud of um. probably my family my my husband and my. my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've. we're an in tact family that. um. my kids see every day how. their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and. they um. they actually express. gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family. so i would say that's probably it [Interviewer]: that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. probably the. one of my best qualities is. uh. being able to listen to people and being able to um. not be judgmental um. through the years i've had a . a lot of experience with um. people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and. it's just taught me that um. everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems. and um i don't think i'm better than someone else. if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough [Interviewer]: yeah thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: okay i think i've asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye

[Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: um child development [Interviewer]: that sounds interesting [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: well um. i've always been interested in children um since i was younger. um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age. and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do. um so. uh that's when i um looked into child development courses. and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so. um i started taking classes and um the rest is history [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: i am yes it's been um. fifteen years in august [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job. i would say um. to become a principal [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um. i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses. um so that i can make that happen. because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you [Interviewer]: that's great how hard is that [Patient]: um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me. and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine. so it's something that i'm willing to. i'm willing to do [Interviewer]: i understand do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um. a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um. and and outgoing as well um. but i think a little bit of both i would say [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. uh i meditate. i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating. i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time [Interviewer]: uh huh how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: oh wow i'm very very good at that. very good at controlling my temper i um. again um. a series of. meditation that i do um. it involves deep breathing and um. just really centering yourself. to where you can feel your heart beat and you can. um really feel everything in your body. and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger. and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot [Interviewer]: mhm that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: oh wow. it was just recently um actually unfortunately. it was last week and it was with my husband. and um. it was about um. just the way he responds sometimes to me. uh it can be a little aggressive. um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression. i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so. yeah that was it [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt. very frustrated. um and i actually felt angered too um. but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so. it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: uh <sigh>. a situation which i wish i would've handled differently. honestly i haven't had a situation like that in. in years i've pretty much kind of. um. you know kind of mastered. my responses um. to certain um. stimuli. i've kinda got that down [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision i've ever had to make. well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage. um mother. i was pregnant at sixteen and. um i had um. a lot of pressure from family to um. give my child up for adoption or to. um abort. and i chose life so that was. that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old. teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager. or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so. that i think was the hardest decision. i had to make [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: um. well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later. and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by. not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life. pro-choice pro-life and um. eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and. i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: i do yeah [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties. um just as anything. um. but at the end of the day it is really rewarding. um. and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised. become a productive citizen and go out into society and. just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is [Interviewer]: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: oh wow. so many ways um. the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um. accept his feedback even if i don't like it. and i um allow him to express his self. fortunately unfortunately when i was little um. there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child. um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it. um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self. i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age. and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um. make sure that you nurture that um because that's. kind of um. the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um <sigh>. well. it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up. so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that. it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away. and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so. it varies [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um. i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but. other than that i i've been feeling really good [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no i haven't [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no i have not [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up. i'm happy because. that is a chance for me to. take advantage carpe diem seize the day. so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because. i realize that some people did not wake up. some people are homeless some people. are going through so many situations that are really disheartening. and that's not me so. i feel really really blessed. every day [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um as um. nurturing patient loving. friendly. um. kind of reserved [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree. and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable. in certain subjects. and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things. and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: you know what no regrets no regrets um. you live and learn um nothing is perfect. um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today. so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today [Interviewer]: mhm what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to. get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship. even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um. to stay focused and to. get a great education [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: i'm most proud of um. where i've come from um. as a teenage mother. um being a statistic and actually changing that. being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that. i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married. um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but. um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of. my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised. i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um. i really um applaud myself for that [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: you're welcome

where are you from originally [Patient]: uh born and raised in los angeles california [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like. do two drastically different things in one day [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh. lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but. pretty young [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: hmm <laughter> [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old. and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh. we left. um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change. the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: it was it was delicious <laughter> [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: yep <laughter> [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: scrubbed_entry. graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications. so i can go into the military as an officer [Interviewer]: what made you

place for me [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's. however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: yeah. but uh. probably [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken [Interviewer]: that's great sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i'm pretty good um. i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year. and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do. decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's. i don't i don't know [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um <sigh>. hm <sigh>. so many um. i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted. so it sucks but. hey [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: that is an intriguing question <sigh> um. i've actually no clue [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: the death of my grandmother [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: sure. um. my grandmother died when i was eleven years old. she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me. she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well. and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family. and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother. and it was it was tough but. um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth. and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now. but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them. and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter> [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh sure um hm hm uh. i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets. and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail. that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had. three failure to appears in court which sucked. tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so. i don't know. it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but. there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and. yeah [Interviewer]: yeah how do you cope with them [Patient]: thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate. to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really. so i i just bottle it up like i do. everything [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe [Interviewer]: i see have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: hm really happy oh. why is that such a difficult question uh. mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day. seems like [Interviewer]: okay tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: uh dunking. across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there. and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah [Interviewer]: nice how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: mm i have. four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each. and i don't know studious hardworking. determined. mm i don't know [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: <laughter> yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: hmm <sigh>. i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh. uh grade school. i was uh i wasn't the best of students but. i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad. and down [Interviewer]: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've. getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: uh. i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad. and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully. and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock. that was thousands of pounds didn't work [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation is there anything you regret [Patient]: about that day or in general [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: mm. other than like the u_c

there's not much job opportunities so. it's kinda limited [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: yeah it does <laughter> [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um my dream job. i would like to own. a restaurant. a nice a bar restaurant [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than. most places you go to. or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of. worn out run down so. something nice something different something creative. something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible. <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm definitely more shy. but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but. initially i'm pretty shy [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: good idea. um a lot of times i. try to just. lay back and you know do some deep breathing. just kind of clear your mind. or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book. kinda just takes your mind away [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: relax [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now. learned that you shouldn't. react immediately to situations you should. you know think before you speak that type of thing [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago. <laughter> [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and. wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so. i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: frustrated [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: like. yeah i guess. everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that. you know. of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: <tisk> but yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion. um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know. or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh. you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or. that type of thing [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: <tisk> um <sigh>. leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago. i went to school in san diego and i. immediately wanted to come back so. i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: mm. i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i. i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so. employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others. so not be so much of a burden to people around me [Interviewer]: yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days [Patient]: <tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: it's good. it's very good. we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so. it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well. could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good [Interviewer]: that's good yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper [Interviewer]: what are you like when you

with people [Interviewer]: mhm that's good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy. but given a choice i'd rather be. um you know. a little more pulled back <laughter>. uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go. so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think [Interviewer]: i understand can you give me an example of that [Patient]: an example hmm. well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: okay. well example like uh traveling. sometimes you wanna go to a particular place. and it's uh. something great happening there. even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot. um. now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um. xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink. um. is that a good getaway spot still right now. something like that you know [Interviewer]: yeah i see [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: mm. uh me i huh. i take walks. i call up a friend we have tea or something you know [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: mm eh. uh. it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again. i don't really dwell on. negative things too much [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: uh [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: um i don't have any regrets right now mm [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: i really can't think of anything right off the top [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision i've ever had to make. was uh. not hiring a good friend. uh for a job that. you know they weren't qualified for. that's hard [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence [Interviewer]: yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: my father [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh he just uh. taught me how to. you know uh overcome. uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up. uh. and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough. and i i found that to be true so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um. it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh. my. distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can. mm yeah [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know. uh it's nothing like mhm yeah [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh. well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so. i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that. you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it [Interviewer]: mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: well uh. i guess i'll be a little bit uh. uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep. you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um. uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm [Interviewer]: okay how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i feel okay now [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: uh. changes like what [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: mm. well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh. i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes [Interviewer]: that's good have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: never [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: uh i feel okay now [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: uh i went to a great party last week. that was really cool [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me more about that [Patient]: well it was like on a rooftop uh. and a a lot to really uh. nice people. who are basically in the same kind of uh. mindset. uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals. and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information. and a lot of good connections were made [Interviewer]: that's great how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome [Interviewer]: tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: my ideal weekend. is uh. cooking my own food relaxing. you know and. if i'm in the mood for company you know. i have friends and uh. you know uh family members join me [Interviewer]: uh huh what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well. i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work. i eat like crazy and nothing happen [Interviewer]: (laughter tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: mm. well you know i i think people in general sometime uh. uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh. if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a. if a different set of things. make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking. um people tend to misjudge you. you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime. but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me. you know that's hey. maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: uh my best qualities probably um. uh listening i think. <mumbling>. and uh. maybe just uh talking. uh you know on a conversational level [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: uh [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: yeah. sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that. but uh you know. i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so. when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: uh uh. go for your dream. believe in what you're doing. don't let anyone discourage you. and you'll be okay. and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself [Interviewer]: mm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: most proud of um. i think my um. my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about. not being too too anxious about. about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen. and you shouldn't really uh. never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have. arrived at that point. in my. my my thinking my framework. uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently [Interviewer]: yeah okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: <mumbles>. very good questions [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: uh i [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer    i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: where are you from originally [Patient]: um moscow [Interviewer]: really why'd you move to l_a [Patient]: um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]:  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though [Interviewer]: that's good how do you like your living situation [Patient]: it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between [Interviewer]: [laughter] [Patient]: the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while [Interviewer]: yeah how do you know them [Patient]: one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist [Interviewer]: how close are you to them [Patient]: it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um. i guess pretty close. right now we're kinda distant [Interviewer]: aww tell me more about that [Patient]: oh about the distant [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks. 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room [Interviewer]: uh oh [Patient]: and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move  [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: it's okay it'll get better [Interviewer]: yeah how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: it depends with whom . i'm. dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good. but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter] [Interviewer]: [laughter] that makes sense [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: uh probably my best friend nicole. she's probably been we've been best friends for like. god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: um [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: of. of what  [Interviewer]: how do you know them [Patient]: uh my friend nicole [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um we met in french class freshman year of high school. we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are some things you like to do for fun [Patient]: um. uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking. staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography. um. just hanging out with friends i guess. whatever [Interviewer]: okay how close are you to your family [Patient]: uh. it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um. those kinds of. things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things.  i don't really discuss that with them [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: so i guess superficially close [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again. i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant. and. uh. conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um. what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]. but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess [Interviewer]: yeah  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh yesterday. and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money . and so and. so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through [Interviewer]: [laughter] yeah do you feel that way often [Patient]: about other people or about myself or angry [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: xxxx [laughter]. um. angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often [Interviewer]: okay what's your dream job [Patient]: dang it. that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me. um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um.  my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. i guess it's something that i realized. i like to see. the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so [Interviewer]: mhm yeah [Patient]: something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography. i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something. in that. realm i guess [Interviewer]: okay do you travel a lot [Patient]: i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that. i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and. see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to. stir things up [Interviewer]: i see what you mean i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: oh gosh okay um. i'm trying to think. one of my trips. i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is. one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon [Interviewer]: oh my gosh [Patient]: i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so. um. and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made. and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like. white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful. or something that's different too [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean [Patient]: cool [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um. pretty easy as long as I. get well no i always sleep so easy [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world [Interviewer]: do you feel that way often [Patient]: i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of . energizing me so no it's not too bad. that's good [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in. so. it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing [Interviewer]: yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days [Patient]: yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so [Interviewer]: yeah do you feel down [Patient]: uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter] [Interviewer]: nice [Patient]: yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry [Patient]: it's all good [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: nope [Interviewer]: have you ever served in the military [Patient]: nope [Interviewer]: okay what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense [Interviewer]: yeah yeah what do you do to relax [Patient]: uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v. [laughter]. but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap. or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done. so [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: [laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year [Interviewer]: aww [Patient]: and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter] [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um [Interviewer]: [laughter] [Patient]: probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter] [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah it was cool [Interviewer]: okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye [Patient]: [laughter] bye

great situation  [Patient]: thanks [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote

much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time [Interviewer]: right how hard is that [Patient]: well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: no i'm pretty good at it now. maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today

deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but. my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family   [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: no <laughter> [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home [Interviewer]: mhm can you give me an example of that [Patient]: well um. by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature [Interviewer]: mhm  tell me about your kids [Patient]: i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: yeah i'm 'bout to be. well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time [Interviewer]: wow awesome  [Patient]: yeah thank you [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: the hardest thing is. well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: with my kids or just period [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know. you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me  [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment  [Patient]: happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so. i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds like a great situation  [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: hm. well the advice i would've gave myself. that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that. i probably would've. stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um. rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um. education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day. so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career [Interviewer]: right yeah could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: i'm not quite sure um. you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so  [Interviewer]: yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there  [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: my oldest daughter. we had a argument because. just. the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through. and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know. hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or . or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: that just happened you know. i just told her i'm not [Interviewer]: how close are you to them [Patient]: i'm sorry [Interviewer]: how close are you to them [Patient]: very close. very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life. and I'll be telling [Interviewer]: tell me more about that [Patient]: she's um. she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change [Interviewer]: yeah how hard is that [Patient]: it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but [Interviewer]: yeah yeah [Patient]: the ball is her court you know. i only can do so much [Interviewer]: i'm sorry i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: oh wow. i have my days um. since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like. <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know [Interviewer]: mhm do you feel that way often [Patient]: pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me [Interviewer]: right what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: what am i like irritated tired um lazy. you know. feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter> [Interviewer]: <laughter> what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: i never thought about that. i just you know.

your most memorable experiences what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so. my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was. um being on a bus and and leaving. um dublin and going just out to the countryside and. seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but. when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible [Interviewer]: awesome awesome [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies [Interviewer]: are you still working in that are you still working in that

[Interviewer]: yeah yeah what made you decide to do that what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. to. guess i'm not clear on the question um [Interviewer]: let's come back to that later let's

sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and. um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother. um last may and we've been. we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so [Interviewer]: that's good that's good how did you feel in that moment how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. <mutters>. well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother. um. i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so. yeah [Interviewer]: mhm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm shy [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter>. um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance. i love to read. i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else. um. i like to be with friends um. i love art and. trying new restaurants um. yeah all those things are. both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that. um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: yeah yeah [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter> [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be. oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery. yeah that was the last time so [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of. uh it didn't show up. and. uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until. um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and. they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that. the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so. i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um. let me think about one. um the other day i had a phone call. and i'm in a coaching program and. it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program. and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with. and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. um. someone who's not my coach and uh that. hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that what made you decide to do that [Patient]: oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah [Interviewer]: how hard is that how hard is that [Patient]: um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation [Interviewer]: i see how have you been feeling lately how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy [Interviewer]: i'm sorry i'm sorry [Patient]: <laughter> thanks [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: i have in the past yeah [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help what got you to seek help [Patient]: i was suicidal [Interviewer]: do you feel down [Patient]: oh yeah i feel down mhm [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: i don't actually no [Interviewer]: why did you stop why did you stop [Patient]: um. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see. and. you know work through that situation and come up with um. a strategy for. not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the last time you felt really happy tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow. huh. wow that's pretty sad. um it was at least a year ago. no i that's not true it was. when i um. saw my biological mother which was last may [Interviewer]: what would

intelligent. and. um. yeah [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: anything i regret. i don't think so. no [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago

pretty good i guess i haven't. yelled in a long time [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion.  and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their. opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was. uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes. things are not

scrubbed_entry. um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just. kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend. and it didn't turn out. you know not all. nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little. uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and. i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up. yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh. maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision. huh. hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a. yeah that could've been the hardest [Interviewer]: yeah what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. it's just uh i don't. i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: but um. yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um. but another reason why i. decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was.  also because um art institute you know um that's a. that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician. being taught by a musician [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: to. make music. and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know

not from out there you know so yeah [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: hm. if i. if i um. it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i. remember to breathe and go through my mantras or. remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um. but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice. a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice. pretty

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: okay. yes i am [Interviewer]: okay

when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to. go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean [Interviewer]: nice what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter> [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from. so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home. so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom. and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way [Interviewer]: that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: experiences on vacation or [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um most memorable experience. probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so. having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause. no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter awesome what did you study at school [Patient]: business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field. so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job. hmm. well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook. and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family. if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now. but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm outgoing [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter> that's cool <laughter>. uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at. and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e. so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation. figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first [Interviewer]: mhm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with. um i don't really let anything agitate me. and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just. do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it. be who you are and just stay there [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it. and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways. and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because. the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic. and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard [Interviewer]: mm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hmm <sigh> let's see. i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old. and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it. he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him. as opposed to waiting him to call me. and i think. it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come. and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place. but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but. i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult. and then also not expected him to just kinda you know. i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense [Interviewer]: uh huh do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and. i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so. it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally. so. my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect. so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect [Interviewer]: that's good what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change. but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just. kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that. i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own. and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but. whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me [Interviewer]: yeah what's the best thing about being a parent [Patient]: it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real. it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy. um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own. and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just. being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that [Interviewer]: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here. so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing. it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure. uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling. but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter. so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me. and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore. and. since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while. um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just. did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of. how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything. physical and and all the material stuff i could care less. but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that. he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it. bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home. and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through. and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself. in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day. my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night. i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody. did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma. i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today. and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to. go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day [Interviewer]: that's good how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son. my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance. but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle. that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little. mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no i haven't thank god [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: really happy let's see. uh it's at home and i think it was when. wow. <mumbling> different things running through my head um. i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on. our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me. and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me. without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself. and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very. tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very. you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be. um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do. and i just you know i don't. i don't deal with b s <laughter> [Interviewer]: mhm what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: hmm what could i change about myself. uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself. um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um. i think i would just be. a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware. make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody [Interviewer]: uh huh is there anything you regret [Patient]: i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me. so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret. because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that. everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it. what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys [Interviewer]: i understand what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: hmm. be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am. to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure. be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me. don't try to revamp <re>. don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not. uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders. but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it. but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what. at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle. that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary. scrubbed_entry. and i'm always just. true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that. i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from [Interviewer]: yeah okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: <laughter>. cool [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: um i'm doing good what about you [Interviewer]: that's good i'm great thanks [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: where are you from originally [Patient]: um. l_a <l> los los angeles but. i currently reside <res>reside in inglewood. wait did i answer your question [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: i don't know [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: l_a. um. the murals. the ocean. what else. the people. my family's over here so. that's the best part [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: what about you. oh wait yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: um. i would say. the smog. yeah the air it could be cleaner. and [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah. um. that's pretty <pre> i mean. there's good people and bad people too. but yeah for the most part it's all good [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples. and northern california so yes [Interviewer]: nice what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: traveling. like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body. cleaner bloodflow. the um people. culture. and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends [Interviewer]: that makes sense i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: yeah um any time. like right now. or when [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples. and um it started raining. so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go. the the smaller the steps get. so. like people back then had. uh smaller feet. so what happened was. as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways. so my feet could measure up to the the the steps. but once you get up there it's a nice view. i yeah [Interviewer]: awesome what did you study at school [Patient]: uh general education but. um mainly art. yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um well. when i was a kid. i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so. i just pursued it. so. yeah [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job. would be to get paid for painting. painting art [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: yeah. um. yeah. pretty simple [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um. it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion. um. persistence. and faith and will. you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i consider myself to be shy in certain um. time and places. but i am also out outgoing when. like i have the energy. so. i feel like it's well balanced you know. like i'm shy when it's. i guess. okay to be shy. you know. and i'm outgoing when. like the need to actually. um have fun or just explore. it feels good like. if that makes sense but yeah [Interviewer]: i understand sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. yeah. to uh relax. um. either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>. so that helps. and. i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax. you know especially when i use the color blue. because the color blue um relaxes me. and also green. when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: my temper. um well my thoughts. my thoughts control my emotions. and my emotions. yeah that's pretty much how. my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad. or if i do get mad what will be the outcome. you know. so. controlling my temper is just. by training my thought [Interviewer]: mm when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um <sigh>. the last time i argued with somebody. was with my with my father. and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine. so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no. so that kinda frustrated me. and. the way i handled it was like well. i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so. you know. and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace. so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: my family. um it's pretty good. um. my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married. and my brothers and sisters. um we help one another out. so that's good it's just. yeah it's like a team [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: a situation i wish i could handle differently would be. hmm. that's a good question. i mean. can i get a scenerio [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: okay. um. a situation i could handle differently. well see that's the thing like i feel like. if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out. you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube. maybe. how would i handle the situation would be just by. uh failing um failing making mistakes. because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after. so. that's the best way i could answer your question. you know [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: a positive influence. pretty much. anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know. like. yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt. well they're not trying to be mean they're actually. good influences so i would say my friends. uh my mom my dad. my brother my sisters. yeah [Interviewer]: mm tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: mm. well see that's the thing like. you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife. but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware. and. it taught me how to read people a little bit more like. just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like. scar me. it did prepare me for like. the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like. you know like guns knives and all that stuff so [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: it's it's bad but it's good in the long term. you know because. if you get out of that slump. it's like. nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know. and [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest. um. man. this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: life changing. whether to continue school. college. or not. mm i kinda chose. to like. i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like. like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in. so that was a hard choice because there was no. um guarantee that i would. like. run into like the right people. but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so. yeah [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: yeah. yeah [Interviewer]: that's good how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um it's actually really easy. i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know. i could just

lately [Patient]: lately. i've been feeling. good. i've been feeling like i have free will. like at this point in time i feel like. if i chose a path any path. with like. my heart. i could. get there you know. but i'm kind of like. still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air. just trying to make my own i don't know. that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will. so yeah [Interviewer]: that's great have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: lately like in the past two weeks or today [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind

right now like [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. because. yeah it's like. it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far. like. one could take a thought. and then make it. reality. so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now. this experience this this whole experience. yeah [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: uh post traumatic stress disorder. no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: depression i know how it's like to be depressed. but

bird in a cage. being depression is like. being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water. i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. um. pretty much it feels. like you're limited. but then the thing is. to get out of that depression. it's like you have to. awaken and change your perspective. and focus on. like i i would say colors colors help. and people talking to people helps. yeah [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: um being depressed. mm let's see. mm. i don't know. like. it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses. so. like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed. but then what happened i fixed it like. called up a friend and. met up with him and yeah [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know. i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty

teach me um. a certain lesson whether it's art. or just like in my character. and. yeah he would probably just describe me as like. like. like. he would listen. but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do. so pretty much like. i don't know. yeah i mean that's what he tells me. but yeah overall good person [Interviewer]: mm what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um probably just exercise. um my diet food. my food intake. and yeah just exercise. pretty much it [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about

know that looks kinda like. like trash. and then i'd be like oh. damn. either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it. or what i would do back then would be like damn you know. just kinda dwell on that thought. and then just like. stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it. but yeah. usually it's um people's words. and ideas. that [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: yeah. yeah so that's it [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: regret. um yeah i got a couple things i regret [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: like what. well. sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing. but. i mean at the same time i feel like. if i really wanted to go. i would have gone. so yeah. that's kind of a regret in my head [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual. well being. you know. learn how to um handle your

producer. and uh. filmmaker. director [Interviewer]: mhm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: probably outgoing [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life. uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh. kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter> [Interviewer]: that makes sense sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter> yeah. um i uh do meditation. and [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun. and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time. which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out. i'm focusing on something else but. um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about. uh three months now so [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: yeah it is [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um. almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said. that i that i don't. um just because. um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a. awkward social situation but um. you know i make do [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. <makes sound with mouth>. probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh. we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so. at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about. creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh. you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so. that was the end of that [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um <sigh>. i felt. good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties. uh also regretful that you know he didn't. feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off. um but [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: i got over it. um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored. so. you know. i'm uh i'ma keep going [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um <sigh>. hmm. i don't know. i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that. at the moment i can't really think of any. um [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: <deep breath>. um. when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time. but i did it. i i regret it. but um. you know. xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes [Interviewer]: yeah what made you decide to do that [Patient]: selfishness. um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter [Interviewer]: i see [Patient]: um. you know. thinking. you know you only live once and. you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so. that was <wa> that was years ago but. uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so. i regret it [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: <deep breath>. um. shit geez um. i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna. shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager. um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over. and um. i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and. it it was a difficult decision but. i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that. you know we work on stuff together and all that so. it's good [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. maybe i wish i could forget. getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter. uh. you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so. i have a pretty vivid picture of it and. i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: it's positive. they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because. they. don't think that. i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um. you know i have a. a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and. the creative projects that i make so [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: yeah. there's a bit of tension there. just 'cause. you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but. i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but they're sweet people [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: how do i cope with them. uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know. um. cope with them 'cause i love them. i just uh. you know at times i'll just uh. go off on my own for a while. and eh you know take a breather whatever. you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: <deep breath> [Interviewer]: yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: challenging [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work. um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien. something like that. um. yeah it's difficult <di> [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: i'm someone who sleeps in late. so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something. um. i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning. um. yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and. you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: it does suck um it's kinda. something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm. not. you know. getting a steady pay flow for my music production so. yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh>. got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: just. not feeling good getting nervous when. you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or. just something i that doesn't sit. well with me like. being in a. you know a a rushed and. you know stressful work environment it just um. unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to. to give a shit frankly. like. and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and. it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just. i feel like my body rejects things and. yeah [Interviewer]: yeah how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: okay. i've been feeling okay. very uh very reflective very contemplative. you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be. some new people in my life some new people uh in my band. um. you know i'm gonna try to push myself. but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself. it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm. shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by. being so um. shitty <laughter> yeah [Interviewer]: hmm have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: um i was diagnosed um. about uh. twelve years ago

to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh one of my trips would be uh. i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge  [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh. i went there to work for . uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus . so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i. i enjoyed myself you know. through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me . all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh . you know it's been great [Interviewer]: nice what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: uh. probably. um one some of the things i like about l_a. there's not a lot that i like about l_a but. um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: the uh huge uh. um. different different people you know different uh. different ethnics of uh people here you

you know [Interviewer]: yeah what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: traffic <laughter>. uh ignorance uh. being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people. um. that's about it [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: dishonesty [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: pardon me [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened  [Patient]: uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh. you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh. people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: yeah big time [Interviewer]: what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: what do i do when i'm annoyed [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um. probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um. well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis  . and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek [Interviewer]: wow yeah how hard is that [Patient]: uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh . um i'm pretty honest with. i'm open and honest about any anything and everything [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and uh. what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just. you know didn't like that at all [Interviewer]: yeah how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: pardon me [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh. just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh. i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest . um. i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: you know and if you're lying about something well. you just you're always having to cover up uh. more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just. don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: can't do nothing about it [Interviewer]: what are some things you like to do for fun [Patient]: uh fun i. like going to the beach uh. i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting . and i'm pretty gifted at that and um. uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing. uh haven't gone in a while though. and uh. i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um. pick out some of those uh. astronomy uh stars up up there and um . i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um. sunshine just. those i like [Interviewer]: that's great what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: uh most memorable experiences um. good or bad [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: uh. most memorable experiences. uh probably uh. playing with lions and tigers uh. uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle. uh [Interviewer]: oh my gosh [Patient]: uh just enjoying myself [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: i know [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family [Patient]: not. uh i don't have much family as it is. uh. at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh . but i'm not close to i have uh . three brothers one sister. and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings. i speak with one brother. uh quite a bit um. my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me. i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece. some of my nephews and that's about it [Interviewer]: okay could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: have i done anything to avoid it [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: um. to avoid them [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so [Interviewer]: i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh. going on a year um. you know i uh. depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um. so just. wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts . so . or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over. so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: i don't. lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired [Interviewer]: mhm do you feel that way often [Patient]: uh lately i have been probably about the last few months [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. tired <laughter>. um i you know. if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work. um. and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and so. you know um. i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me. and uh. so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about. you know um money um. you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or. mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that  [Interviewer]: mm how do you cope with them [Patient]: how do i what [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: how do i cope with them. um. i just. try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um. i just do it's uh. i'm more of a guy that just. you know it may take me a moment to. to um. say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um. back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me [Interviewer]: yeah has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: if what has gotten me in trouble. my mood swing i mean [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um. yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh. uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are. uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh . on uh how to interview how to uh. how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh. i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who . who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: uh. i've done uh. i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and . and try to uh work on. the issues that were bothering me so um. you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school. and uh. anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities  [Interviewer]: mhm that's good do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: pardon me [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: i still didn't hear you [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: that. people have been deceitful. can you repeat that one more time [Interviewer]: why don't we talk about that later [Patient]: alright [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um. it's tough if you don't you know um. i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um. again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and . and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um. you know. some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and. so i just try to cope with things uh. um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years. actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um. whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  . um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still . uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people. um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so. um. but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um. you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus. that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so i just let it go. i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  [Interviewer]: i understand did you think you had a problem before you found out [Patient]: did i have a problem before i got out [Interviewer]: did you think you had a problem before you found out [Patient]: uh. well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people . um. i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um . a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago . uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older. kind of uh. you know makes it work you know [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: me me dealing with life so [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you [Patient]: pardon me [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you [Patient]: uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while. uh recently. and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um. a lot of people may not understand that but uh. a therapist is. i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh. people you know uh. uh. other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like. you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others. uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who. will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: but it's good to have [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: well i don't go anymore uh so um. i kinda miss it you know like i said uh. uh. i miss it a lot actually but uh. it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will [Interviewer]: why did you stop [Patient]: um well monetary reasons and uh. you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know money situation's not that great right now so [Interviewer]: i'm sorry how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: how does my friends describe me [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um. they would probably describe me as uh. uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people. um. laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot [Interviewer]: <laughter> [Patient]: um. but uh. they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh . uh. hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and uh so  [Interviewer]:  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life  [Patient]: someone who has been a positive influence in my life [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: someone who's been um. someone who's been a positive influence in my life. uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh. with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh. uh german and um. they didn't. teach i don't know what he saw in me but. he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um. showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and uh. sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it. you know [Interviewer]: that

[Patient]: um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today. and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people. so i wanted something that would bring me. interaction with people so i went into marketing. and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school

other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her. but it obviously did. and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did. and that's what started the argument [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter. and i never would wanna hurt her. and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me. and we

too close. we need a little more space [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: making the right decisions about things sometimes

more freedom to find out who they are. um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual. um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip. and um. i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was. you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter> [Interviewer]: could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: yeah i could've stayed home <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: wow i'm trying to think about a situation. maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a. a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive. and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going. 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father. so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision. i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision i've ever had to make. the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke. was going to make an a connection. and. to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me. and he told me. that i could not get on that plane. because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself. i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on. to montgomery alabama where we were headed. and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go. but my life was in the balance. so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle> [Interviewer]: oh my gosh how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week. and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work. and i'm on a plane and i feel this. weird feeling coming over the left side of my body. and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong. it was it was when you to your life. and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing. very traumatic. and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to. the hospital in a. medical ambulance. that was a weird experience [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry [Patient]: yeah but i'm here. i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so. the universe wasn't finished with me yet [Interviewer]: mhm yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um. sleeping a little bit sometimes i. i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um i'm sluggish. um probably a little on edge. but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person. so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you. so [Interviewer]: uh huh how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: lately i've been feeling really well um except. i've been having some. problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive. that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't. fortunately <for> fortunately. my i didn't lose my facial structure or. you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use. but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work. um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat. energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful [Interviewer]: yeah have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no but i went through depression. uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher. every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from. having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep. from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head. so [Interviewer]: okay do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: no only i don't go to therapy because. um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical. it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: so that i can. get well. 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing. so that's kind of depressing. to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year. i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i. get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year. and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job. and my life is kinda up in the air right now. 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle> [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: i feel happy every day every day i wake up. and i can breathe and i can see. and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing. to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle> [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear is there anything you regret [Patient]: mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now. so just live <li> move forward [Interviewer]: mhm what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way. you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: energetic talkative. uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable. um good spirited. giving loving [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um i'm most proud of that. i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before. i taught art <sniffle> um i was. in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint. um i'm a doll collector. uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me. being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out. and just go take pictures and that was so. soothing to my soul. that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it [Interviewer]: that's great okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: uh huh. and that's is that it bye bye [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

handled differently [Patient]: uh. some of the instances when i might've been with him and i. you know got emotional or. let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than. um. just you know seen it as. not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so. you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate. but some people. you know don't respond to the so-called norm. if you ignore it. mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case. i taught middle school kids and you can try calm [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain. you know your professional demeanor so you can't really. um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so [Interviewer]: i see what you mean tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: well that could be. several. mm. um i guess a decision in um. along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery. uh. that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way. and in that case she died so. you know. uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious. outcome for them as well [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing. things that you might could do but. they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to. erase them you know if. you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a. strong reaction and they don't really look past the. uh impact of the event. 'cause there might be something that [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: you can gain from that [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but there are i i grew up in a home of. dysfunction so there was. just domestic abuse you know and um. there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things. but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things. that occur in life as an adult that. sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that. have not had really strong experiences. fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so [Interviewer]: right how do you cope with them [Patient]: um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can. walk them through. levels of. understanding and you know. as you know someone. you have a balance of background information on. which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will. progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like. the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be. and you can also relate other experiences to them. of things that were worse or. you know seem to be. and of course there's always in general i mean. when you look at all the calamities in the world. you know most of those things aren't affecting. us or the people that we know here [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so that provides. us perspective that. you know can pull someone out of their. i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly. intensity of their experience right at the moment [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well we have a a good relationship they. eh for the most part there are different levels of. um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has. made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others. some have not had um. as much. experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way. so it's always evolving. and i. walk in positivity as a a lead of. you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender. a more positive. response from them. rather than feed. sometimes the. um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have [Interviewer]: mm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: pardon. i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: well my mother has always been a very calm. um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of. negativity i've had teachers that have um been. very um. positive <po> positive and proactive. and have you know taught independent thinking and. techniques to rise above some of the things that. were occurring. and just various friends that you know i would see handling. situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good. um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or. you know um. trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but. um. in general i don't have a problem sleeping. it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done [Interviewer]: i see what you mean how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so. um but in general good [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: like. i mean. not in particular. i mean i just seems. um. less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do. in a shorter period of time but. you know reorganizing. some of the. things that need to be done. you know can smoothe that out [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no i haven't but i know it's something that. a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have [Interviewer]: right have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: i have not no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: well there's several i guess um. and happiness comes in. small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning. is great. wonderful. you know day of happiness um. as far as big. celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum. you know. in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know a moment shared with someone you know so. it should be an even on an even keel [Interviewer]: i understand mhm how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. as uh uh. perseverant. um you know i will. continue forth and. and um. positive. upbeat [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. maybe not doing. things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or. or spending my. time you know a little more differently but. that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see. you know you could've done some things differently. instead of buying. the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: i would have um. made myself move to california sooner and i'm. i would have um. instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss>. would have you know the situation i have now. waited to get something different but you know how can you. you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time. with the best information <in> information available [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know after you have looked at several options [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: of um. being. independent and educated able to. uh take care of myself [Interviewer]: that's great okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye bye now
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: <clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh. i slept. all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school. it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school. i only have school on the weekdays. so i actually slept probably like. eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good. but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today [Interviewer]: okay where are you from originally [Patient]: i'm originally from bakersfield. california [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: really [Interviewer]: when did you move to l_a [Patient]: uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then. i left here when i was around three or four. and i've been move i moved back here. in oh seven and i've been living here. um ever since [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: um. wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat>. maybe like. a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer. like in oh. eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here. unfortunately [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: uh <sigh> uh <laughter>. uh it compares to l_a. um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i. anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um. l_a has all the stuff to do it has um. oceans and it's by all kinds of um located. um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh. san diego and what have you not so <s> um. but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss. like the actual city. i just miss uh some of the people that. i grew up with [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of. california like six times so. i would like to travel. once i uh. have enough money to do so [Interviewer]: okay what did you study at school [Patient]: um. well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker. and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um. studying <stu> i was. took i took communications and uh. did general ed stuff too and um. took like video production classes and um <tisk>. <lip smacking>. did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking. and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back. here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento. but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be. uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done. with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and. become an optician so [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans. and i still actually i got into um playing poker. a few years ago and i really like. the idea of becoming. a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are. extremely difficult to make a living out of and you. have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then. hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: to be an optician [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: oh um. uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but. it just like specifically. trains you into um. one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and. all these other classes like you normally would do for like um. like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field. i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si>. it sound like something maybe i could do. it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually. um got my attention to be an optician so. i'm now trying to be an optician [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: and it's interesting so. it's fun it's um. really hard but it's interesting and it. and it um. and it's it's fun it has um rewarding. um. rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see. better and feel comfortable with. glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel. more comfortable with [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: cool [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy. sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because. talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: or uh animated or whatever <laughter>. so. cool. but no usually ninety eight percent [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe. this might go for some of the poker players too um. i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like. um i actually. playing poker is um. actually something that. helps me forget about anything as far as like um. stuff in the past or present. um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela>. i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy. thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past. i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however. playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um. catch twenty two or whatever but uh [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball. i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually. one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does. um it makes me feel good. but it i didn't go. i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the. cold season. so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like. i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and. all six of 'em were started by the other person. so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but. talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like. thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been. a couple times maybe in the past where like i. wasn't able to control it. but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would. but for um. majority of the time yeah i don't have like. people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um. on the freeway and stuff but uh [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really. um petty things i guess that maybe we just. i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh. we just bumped heads too much so. obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: we just argued about. girlfriend boyfriend things [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: uh. um. i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um. handled differently. there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh. uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and. i was um working for. scrubbed_entry. production assistant for filmmakers around. um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned. and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment. and then i got involved with like uh the wrong. group of people i guess and. kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment. so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with. those kind of people that kinda of girl. um uh. ever. uh because <clears throat> i woulda. probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason. and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh. <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um. not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: mm. hardest decision i guess. i guess uh hardest decision. the hardest decision i have ever had to make. would be um. i guess you could say uh i don't really know. was gonna say that uh. maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like. stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh. would like to be with her and miss her. but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like. i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and. i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that. i don't think it would end up working out anyways so. i guess the decision my hardest decision would be. to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her. and uh. be uh not with her so. i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um. i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been. happier in that way but stressed out and. um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so. it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it. not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me. or whatever so [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: cool [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: oh what was that. i beg your pardon [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: nevad. i don't understand the first part of that question [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: oh an event. oh an event okay um that i could erase. <sigh>. uh event that i could from my memory. uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her. my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w>. we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard. so. i guess both of them [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep. anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so. as they say [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: <tisk> uh no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess. i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week. but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen. had worse things happen so yeah. i guess [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: <sigh>. well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted. people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know. that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work. and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just. try to stay busy and. staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping. a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so. um i don't know. uh playing poker. playing basketball [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: deals helps me deal with it and like uh. hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: why. uh uh. uh i felt really happy on friday because um. i went to san diego for the first time. and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so. i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was. happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um. had a good time [Interviewer]: that's great what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: oh. she's. <sigh>. um <laughter>. a lot of things but i guess i would say like. be nicer to like um. family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been. different to um. acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh. i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did. like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just. really focused on um schooling and stuff and then. did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more. uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh. stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but. i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason. um. so i guess everything's happening. now for a reason. so i'm just gonna keep going [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <laughter>. uh. <tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one. and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like. um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy. uh loud uh. silly. uh smart. and uh. i just in i guess in uh in general just like. entertaining to be around. have. i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so that's it like [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: cool. um <sigh>. change myself uh. <tisk> i wish i was um. <xxx> i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter. um. i wish i didn't need. uh. how do i say put this uh i feel like. um. i feel like i'm a i feel like i. i need to be like in a relationship with a girl. i feel like i wish i didn't have to be. like feel like. that i needed to have a girl all the time. and so i could that could help me like focus more. and i wish that like i didn't need. sexual um. i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like. me having to be in a sexual. thing with them like. as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like. if i didn't concentrate or have to do. like get be with girls or in a relationship to like. well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know. that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit. where like i i could focus on more things other than just. i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: but. yeah so i'm trying i'm working on that [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh> what am i most proud of. uh. i'm most proud of. <makes sounds with mouth> the the. i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um. film sets 'cause like i. i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then. two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor>. working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really. really um. really um. good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so. um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like. over ten years ago but i you know hopefully. something like that could happen again soon or

once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once [Interviewer]: awesome  is there anything you regret  [Patient]: not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger . but um. there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving. my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: done a lot more when it comes to that  [Interviewer]: could you have done anything to avoid it   [Patient]: yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us    . i think that people <peop> most people [Interviewer]: there are always trade offs in life aren't there [Patient]: oh yes very definitely  [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: ooh . that's a good question ten or twenty years ago . i would've said um. don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either. sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted . nothing's promised  [Interviewer]: yeah  have you ever served in the military  [Patient]: oh heaven forbid . <laughter> no i have not <laughter> [Interviewer]: <laughter> have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d  [Patient]: no no  [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression  [Patient]: no  [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep   [Patient]: very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit . i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  [Interviewer]: mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well  [Patient]: tired . i don't get irritable i think i just uh. lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit  [Interviewer]: okay  how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping . uh. and i get a good night's sleep  [Interviewer]: that's good  [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  [Patient]: no i have not . um. no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now [Interviewer]: that's so good to

. being a parent is forever <laughter> so  [Interviewer]: what's the best thing about being a parent  [Patient]: uh <sigh> let's see . taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life  . i think that that's rewarding [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent  [Patient]: making sure everything is covered . that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe. physically mentally spiritually everything [Interviewer]: that makes sense  how would your best friend describe you  [Patient]: hmm. my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh. level-headed. but uh

with. with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got. um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: trying to. you know say you know what's this what's this. uh it was very humbling. um. you know just just seeing that. you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult [Interviewer]: mhm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm probably more of a shy person [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: genetics i don't know why [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction. i've also studied uh computer networking [Interviewer]: cool how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um. it was. i guess. just uh kinda circumstances. i needed. the. the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family. and. i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: mm. uh it's given me a lot of opportunity. but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary. uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall. uh for four years. and last year we we trained in north carolina. for one year. um and that was like theology and bible training [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. basically god put. a um. a desire in my heart to get beyond. get beyond myself and and do something for other people. to to go and. and learn about another people their culture. and to share the gospel with them [Interviewer]: that's great tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well in my immediate family. um. i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters. and then um. but i i have one older brother. uh no sisters. um. so what what do you wanna know about my family [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family [Patient]: um. i'm really close with my wife and my daughters. uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped. um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old. even though he's he's five years older than me. so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him. but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents [Interviewer]: i see who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. i'd say my. my youth pastor in high school. he was a real real positive influence in me [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. just he has a. he has a drive and a zeal for. for pursuing the truth. um. and just uh. studying the bible and. and because of his influence that kinda. put me on a path to wanting to study the bible [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i think i've gotten better at it. there have been. times when. you know i'll i'll get angry. and uh. you know it can just. kinda really rule over me just the frustration. and i'm the type of person that it takes me. um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to. to calm down again. but i've. i've learned um. over time that really getting angry. um and keeping that anger in doesn't. it doesn't. attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me. and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: to keep so. when <whe> when things anger me i try to. uh. like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it. and and resolve it and come to a resolution. um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um <sigh>. well a. a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago. um. my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. and her parents had already left. um eh we were just driving down to. orange country area for this trip. and. my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed. and. but hadn't really. in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had. and so. when i was trying to meet those expectations. she. um. you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. um and kinda getting attacked for it. so. so then i i i started yelling at her. and [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and we you know we had that conflict but then. you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through. and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. are you asking the moment of during the conflict [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: uh. very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it. in your body. um. part partly i. the i guess the. anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: so. i would think um. yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: mm hmm hmm hmm. i guess it was um. deciding to go. um to go to our training last year. um i i felt that god had put on my heart that. that this was something i was supposed to pursue. um my wife didn't feel that way. and. i. i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and. but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart. so. i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it. um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um. you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going. uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh. you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. um. but then after i kinda gave that up. then. um. then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so. um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um. oh let me see. i'm not sure um. i don't know i i can't really. think of anything very traumatic. um that i would wanna erase but i i think. you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda. shape who we are. and. so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um usually. usually it's not too bad. um. are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um. the the job i work the. the um. kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i. so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts. or graveyard shifts. so. um. coming home in the morning. you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work [Interviewer]: i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh it pretty easy [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh. i i've been feeling good lately [Interviewer]: that's good have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: no not really [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. hmm. i don't know um. can't think of anything that was. kinda out of the ordinary. but. um. yesterday. we my wife and i took. took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one. um stayed with her grandma. but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played. and. yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. i i think he'd say i'm a. a family man. that um. i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me. um usually my my friend i end up doing. um. different work around the house for him. 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so. so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice [Interviewer]: mhm what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. i guess i would um. i guess i would like to be able to. um. start conversations with people. easier. uh sometimes. i have i have trouble. just talking to people. especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. but kinda talking to people in a group. uh i wish i was a little better at that [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: now if it's [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: okay. what what i was gonna say right before that was that um. uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult. uh. advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago. um. probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. um. that's about it [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: think that would made that would've made the biggest difference. in my life i think [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um. well i have i have four kids and. i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that. that um. you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them. through their their journey in life and i hope that they. end up a little. better for it than. than me. um. yeah i just hope. hope kinda through them. that i can. you know. leave <lea> leave something worthwhile [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: you're welcome [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: that's good okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: i'm doing okay it's still morning so [Interviewer]: where are you from originally [Patient]: i'm from the east coast massachusetts [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: when did you move to l_a [Patient]: um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter> [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: um. l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry. and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a. in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so the [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school. but uh. after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses [Interviewer]: that's good what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: um. well i love the beach. and i love the mountains i like to go hiking. um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy [Interviewer]: nice i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: no. not at all [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger. went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately. um overseas [Interviewer]: okay what did you study at school [Patient]: um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit. but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: oh that's alright [Interviewer]: i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job [Patient]: gah. um. i don't have one. to be honest um. i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter> [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment. um as to if we wanna. continue communicating with the person or not. and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot. so [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: yes. um. i like watching movies. i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um not good at times i uh i have a. some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh yesterday. and it was with my partner. and um. actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just. sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself [Interviewer]: yeah has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: so. um. at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind. um i do not. purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. but. i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged. so [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um. uh last year my mother died. so. i wish i handled that differently [Interviewer]: is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this [Patient]: um. it upsets <ups> it's upsets me. so [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: it's okay [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um let me see. <deep breath>. uh <sigh>. i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because. it's like i can't uh. i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind. uh you know thinking about bills and. and. the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode. it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating. everything so [Interviewer]: uh huh what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter>. i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: yeah. so other than that. i'm. i'm okay [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um well i've been i've been depressed. for quite some time. and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty. uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died. so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to. get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do. that i haven't done in a year because of what happened [Interviewer]: that's good that's good have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: um i just. i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat. um. i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep. so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day [Interviewer]: i see have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably. ten to fifteen years ago. and it's just something i've never. gotten over i don't know whether or not. you can so i've always taken the medicine [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um. i was. arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i. was feeling desperate and hopeless. and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago. which caused me to be hospitalized. and then uh. they started treating me i started seeing a therapist. so [Interviewer]: is going to a therapist helping you [Patient]: um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some. avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me. i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there. and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this. and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback. as to how to deal with the emotions. tools to help you deal with your emotions [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: i understand what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: um. like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication. um. there's been no changes really. i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver. and uh. even though a lot of times i. feeled i felt overwhelmed or. lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her. uh. i still was a heck of a lot happier. than i am now. so [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. uh <sigh>. i would say when my son was born years ago [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: i'm not a parent anymore he passed away. so. um. and that was difficult as well [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: uh [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: hmm. um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me. because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained. and

saying and you see it on a bumper sticker. uh. live to never regret. so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation. but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done [Interviewer]: right what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really. give my friends any kind of advice i mean. i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother. um. i just state my opinion that's all [Interviewer]: what are some things

are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag. and um. i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas. i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh. it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it. but uh overall it's okay [Interviewer]: okay what did you study at school [Patient]: uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: that's why that's my that was my major yeah [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um. i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh. it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the. in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um. you didn't see you know too many computers around back then. and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together. you know solving a. a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the. the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um. the problem [Interviewer]: mhm are you still working in that [Patient]: mhm. uh. no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di>. uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um. the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was. i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it. to the degree that i wanted to [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh. well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time. this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um. at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing. job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much. too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know. i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel. fulfillment on but i don't wanna. too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice. relaxing job [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: oh i would say. well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing. um but. i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more. vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much. like once the funny gates open up they kind of. <laughter>. open up too much so i have to like back off you know [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: oh really <laughter>. <laughter>. yeah <laughter>. oh um. well i listen to music um. i'll um well i watch t_v um. i'll um. just what what do i do to relax. well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too. i'll be around an area. around. kind of a comfort area where i. i feel safe i can just. dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my. thinking about my own. problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus. on being in the moment with my um. acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances [Interviewer]: mm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem. it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode. i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more. had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh. uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: wow that's a good question. um. i'm not sure to be honest um. i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that. it's not really part of my repertoire. um nothing comes to mind off top of my head [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: well. um. well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments. back about ten years ago. i was more um. i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people. like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field. and um. i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it. and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity. and um unfortunately i made some bad. financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad. position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up. so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions. that i really regret [Interviewer]: i see tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: wow. hmm. that's a tough one. i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: oh. well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um. it's just me and my uncle. and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um. he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida. so uh we're we're okay. but um. uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um. we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep. and uh he's got his own problems. so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have. so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel. i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem. and um. i have. a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom. and um. so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a. long story short <laughter>. um. it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired. or achy. so it is it is difficult [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: uh <sigh>. well i've been feeling okay i mean um. i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um. i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't. taken uh responsibility for. but um. i feel a bit of calmness as of late [Interviewer]: that's good have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um. i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: the minnesota multifaceted. personality something of whether. this is going back about six months ago. they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my. my well being psychologically too and i think some of the. the answers said that they. advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. i didn't follow that. up on that because. of philosophical differences. but uh i think i might have a you know. a mild case of depression [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: well you know um. like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh. i'm doing okay but i you know i. kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my. my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone. i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to. and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh. there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties. so um. you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: wow. that's a good one <laughter>. really happy um. let me think about that a minute. well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>. okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer. um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow. it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh. we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters. giving out really nice samples. it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a. and um. you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like. have me experience their product or service. and um. i was around people that. i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh. i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh. about a month ago [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah. yeah it was [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: best friend. i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh. i would say um. hmm. i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh. i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter> [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. i i like to be conscientious i. you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall. i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know. say little white lies or you know. i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic. um. i tend to be. pretty calm for the most part [Interviewer]: mhm is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. what do i regret. well can you elaborate that <laughter> [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: uh well um. i just well just overall um. i regret uh. not being a little more assertive in in my earlier. uh earlier life um. and kinda put myself in this position. it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life. i made some bad decisions and unfortunately. i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like. sort of like. living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing. so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all [Interviewer]: mm what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um. i think. i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice. i was kinda going away from. my basic. beingness you know like the way i really felt. like for example i'd make i would do aggressive. uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been. well off for the rest of my life <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but unfortunately it went the opposite way. too too many eggs in that basket. so i kinda regretted going with. my gut feeling and and let other people influence me. and uh. 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments. in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some. aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much. kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: wow. that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>. <laughter> well. i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually. you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows. but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um. you know i'd like to. go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game. uh go to a movie. go out with some friends. so i would just or you know just kinda kick back. but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on. you know earning earning money on the weekends [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: uh. that's interesting. most proud of. um. i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really. bad. bad uh. vice. um. you know i. i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably. i don't know if it's really proud um. but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as. uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: my pleasure [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye now. . . . . . . . . .

talking to and i was arguing about. her lack of communication. and attentiveness. yeah [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: uh frustrated. because um. you know uh you you put in a

step back and and and i assess the situation. you know to see what's what's the best way to to react. towards the situation. and by doing that. it has made me more mature. emotionally more mature. and just. has a positive outcome [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: <laughter>. um. i was lying next to a beautiful woman. who who cared about me and the

more like suburbia. it's nice. um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle> [Interviewer]: mhm why did you move to l_a [Patient]: i went to um grad school at u_s_c [Interviewer]: cool how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in. was so intense that. like for the first year. it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so. that made it kind of. um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so. it wasn't bad [Interviewer]: uh huh what did you study at school [Patient]: film [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad. i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do. and um. just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about. and um. i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school [Interviewer]: that's great are you still doing that [Patient]: um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um. i think that uh. i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of. what um. i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable. um you know full time. nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry. um. and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know. what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting. um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good. place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a. like room to to grow and advance and all that. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: i understand it can be tough to find a good job these days [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i. i like to travel um. i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past. done a fair amount [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: um. i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people. um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know. see. beautiful remarkable. places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle> [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um. let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago. um. my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably. that might be like my. favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful. um. and we just spent like. we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing. and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like. we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of. it hit all of the. you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also. i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: <sniffle> [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. what do i do to relax um. <sigh>. i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will. you know. kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way. um. if i'm home i might just like. you know. throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like. sort of escape relief. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um pretty good i don't i mean. eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath> [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was. like judging me unfairly. and that was upsetting [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um. it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to. my mom on the phone probably like once a week and. my parents are really supportive <sigh> um. they are. you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time. um so i'd say we have a pretty. pretty good relationship [Interviewer]: that's good what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>. i guess because i'm like in this. sort of job hunting. phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like. doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've. sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle> [Interviewer]: i see how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: <deep breath> um <sigh>. usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out. but um i've just had more. uh. like nights where. it either. takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason. um. i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: not that i have been able to identify. i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like. in flux but. i i don't know there was no like event. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good. feeling. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: i understand have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: um. not really no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: <deep breath>. um <sigh>. like <sigh>. i think in like. october or november. although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like. many many years ago <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um. i felt like i was. a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it. <sniffle> [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms [Patient]: um <sigh>. just having a hard time. functioning on the most basic. level like just. getting up and. taking a shower. and like going to the grocery store. and you know. answering emails was just like. it took so much energy. um. so yeah i just i wasn't  really. functioning normally [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]:  yeah [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: yes um. <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: <deep breath> i think that therapy. is good for me because it. helps me focus on. my sort of patterns um. and also like. ah. just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like. um. kind of just reacting to situations i'm like. mm. just like noticing more what is going on um. and it just helps to. um. i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um. i don't know um. i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um. eh maybe over uh. over christmas being at home with my family [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yeah. um. well it just was. that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then. and um. like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of. feeling. not. <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me. um. so when i was there with them it just um. it just felt very like. safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know. warm familial embrace [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um <sigh>. <laughter> i think she would describe me as. funny. and smart. and. um. a good listener. nonjudgmental. um. i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: <deep breath> hmm <sigh>. okay um. so. this happened. the the last like. job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like. a year and a half close to two years and uh. i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>. he sort of out of nowhere. uh. mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um. essentially like. the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project. so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah. and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer. and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how. he. i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know. even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore. he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic. decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me. but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic. yada yada so. to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me. um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point. he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me. and later on like a couple of months down the road. i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still. ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um. this guy who. had worked with us a bunch kind of like. if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff. he was doing my job so [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: yeah so it just like. it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like. that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like. in a way that's like. that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like. angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see. i um. a very loyal person <deep breath> um. i am. smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um. very like caring kind. um. i'm conscientious. and i work hard <sniffle> [Interviewer]: that's great what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <laughter> uh. man. i think. to uh. be more confident. and. less passive. um. to really. like focus on. what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle> [Interviewer]: mm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: hmm <sigh> um. probably just some of the. relationships that i formed with people. um. just like really. you know deep friendships [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your

[Interviewer]: mhm what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: well. being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion. and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great. but [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know you live with that [Interviewer]: i see what you mean what did you study at school [Patient]: um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um. after i finished college i um. uh pursued a career in retail operations [Interviewer]: are you still doing that [Patient]: uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career. uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business. i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um. in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh. and it's very helpful [Interviewer]: that's great i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job [Patient]: <laughter>. well my dream job is um. i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh. independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs. and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do. and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so. i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: mm. i'm not. well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm. probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean. when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um. obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: oh sure you know i have um. uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um. if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: actually um. my relaxation is um i'm currently um. living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work. take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know [Interviewer]: aw how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i'm not um. i'm not a. short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned. there's not there's not much to that [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um. being very difficult to work with um. and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh. they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because. um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: it does <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um. it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and. yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point. or it would it would kill him you know. um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i. i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard [Patient]: it is. it was [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um. well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated. and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together. and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so. she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: and. and so she needs to. uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh. someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child [Interviewer]: yeah what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage. um as far as um. the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: uh yeah i um. got caught up in a situation where. um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart. and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so. you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money. and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship. had to do with trust because um. it it was devastating to my wife [Interviewer]: yeah how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light. um i felt very guilty. and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life [Interviewer]: i'm sorry have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no not at all [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no not really no [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no [Interviewer]: that's good do you feel down [Patient]: no. not at all [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um. after i had my heart attack a few years ago. um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that [Interviewer]: that's great tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: the last time i felt really happy. um. probably when. i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. and um. he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that. he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue. no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack. and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well i guess number one thing is uh. my physical being itself. i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight. um. just in general just be more healthier physically. and as far as mentally um just not. go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: just one day at a time. you know i just uh. try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself. i do things to help myself [Interviewer]: mm is there anything you regret [Patient]: well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage. uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and. and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but. um. at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done. so i don't focus too much on the past. i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing. to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed. um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh. i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um. scrubbed_entry. you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately [Interviewer]: uh huh what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: probably. the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that. um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that. um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive. uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy. and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh. just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night. one day at a time [Interviewer]: yeah how hard is that [Patient]: it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where. you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines. and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore [Interviewer]: mhm how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably. easygoing generous. um a nice person to be around. and um. you know. they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues. uh related to the gambling and the. my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: well my ideal weekend starts off usually um. after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock. um i go to a local park and uh it's about. this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning. um. get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um. you know go home. um work in the yard a few hours. take a shower and relax and then. just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk. work out in the yard. watch t_v whatever just relax. that's how a weekend goes for me [Interviewer]: nice okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: and thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

um. um. eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um. there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um. god. i can't even think of it right now um. but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of. people um i just went on a off season. uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise. uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise. uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental [Interviewer]: that's great do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um i'm outgoing. as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone. um i don't have a problem meeting people. um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter> [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. getting married and having my children <laughter> [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: mm [Interviewer]: tell me about your kids [Patient]: i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not. and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson. and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner. and the other one is a computer engineer. so and i've been married for thirty three years [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and um. basically uh marriage pretty strong [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: you know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door. that you care. and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out. um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem. as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble. and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law [Interviewer]: yeah (laughter what's the best thing about being a parent [Patient]: uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: and i i basically he treats her well [Interviewer]: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um. for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel. and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they. found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one. and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel. so i've made up for her. and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there. i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly. so i made up for it [Interviewer]: okay how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i think before i speak. and then i am the type of person also to um. i take on other people's feelings before i um. blurt out the wrong thing i try to. uh analyze the situation first. before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house. uh we had a disagreement on that um. men have their own way of doing things and um. i had told him not to use a certain uh. eh person to work on our house. but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead. and now he sees all the downfalls. and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so. but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money. and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong. and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project. so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's. but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed. he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter> [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and it didn't make any sense [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance. so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but. um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long. um. i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and that's it [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: um. exercise walk walking more so [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: no not really [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and that gives me satisfaction [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah [Interviewer]: mhm is there anything you regret [Patient]: i'm sorry didn't hear you [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna

think that's a false dichotomy. but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone. and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful [Interviewer]: that makes sense sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. um i listen to music. and just lay on my bed and. um. i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise [Interviewer]: cool how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: pretty good i don't get angry a lot. um. so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: hmm. um. mm what month is this may. probably two months ago. and i argued. via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but. i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor. um. with a friend i've had for a few years [Interviewer]: hmm how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt anxious. um. sad and angry. um. yeah those are the main emotions [Interviewer]: okay how do you know them [Patient]: i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them. and then i'll notice the physical. uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty. if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hmm <laughter>. that i wish i had handled differently. i guess related to this argument um. i went out one night and got. a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up. calling a person for a ride. home but that. really upset that person. and i know that. it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um. it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: mm. <clears throat>. hardest decision <sigh>. wow um. probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards. well after dropping out i had to really. rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to. dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on [Interviewer]: yeah how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um <sigh>. i think by recognizing what i don't want to do. and doing a lot of research on. program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program [Interviewer]: that makes sense tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>. oh <laughter>. um. revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier. it was a dating relationship and. a few years ago we had a falling out. over his treatment of me. and it involved. another person and i wish i could. get that out of my mind [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um <laughter>. <laughter>. i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten. um closer to her as an adult. uh we talk pretty regularly. with my dad i grew up with him. mostly he lives in atlanta and. um we don't talk as much but. we are. we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that. contentious or anything. and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: um so. in general i'm not really that close to family [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five. and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really. opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things [Interviewer]: that's great how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: <sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day. and the thought of it is. you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired. not really feeling refreshed [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: <clears throat> [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: i think just <sigh>. self-talk about how what i have to do. isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year. um. trying to think of things that. i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music. and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going [Interviewer]: mhm how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: <sigh> feeling <sigh>. uh wow um. feeling. emotionally drained on some ways and. at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown. so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of. feeling accomplished and proud at the same time [Interviewer]: uh huh have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no i haven't [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: in two thousand six [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um. i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous. and just all those changes going on. really um. exacerbated . things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there. and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed [Interviewer]: yeah do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: yes i do [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy [Patient]: i notice. i'm better able to. accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them. i'm <sigh>. able to think <th>. think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light. and also identify. the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas. <clears throat> [Interviewer]: that's good tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: mm <sigh>. um this past weekend. i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again [Interviewer]: awesome how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <laughter> um <sigh>. people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very. um analytical. sensitive intelligent. intellectual [Interviewer]: uh huh what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. i wish that i did not. or wait. i wish. i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on. and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy [Interviewer]: okay what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: <laughter>. start going to therapy now <laughter> um. but yeah i really would and. also. to. what how old am i twenty eight. ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school. i

not really. set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose. so [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um my dream job hm. that's a good one. um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great. you know to learn what's going on in the young minds. and you know how we could help children develop a better way. you know make children you know or help. you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: yeah. i just you know help children [Interviewer]: do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know. and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever. i don't really like and there's everyone talking i just i'd prefer just to. stay away from that you know 'cause i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment and time for everything i suppose [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just. get my mind going to another you know. galaxy or universe or. situation you know it's pretty fun you know just. you know reading and then just having just. yourself relaxed and you know feeling good [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yeah it is it's just fun i love reading [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um. i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there. you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep. doing better eventually. but i'm not like the best [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um. but you know i guess that's everyone. i'm not sure haha you know [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh huh. that's a good question. um hm. i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh. honestly i can't recall maybe. uh. my goodness. i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things. you know so um. huh i don't know. i'm not i i i can't honestly i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment [Interviewer]: okay why don't we talk about that later [Patient]: sure yeah probably come back to it [Interviewer]: what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: um. huh. well i guess. when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't. and that makes me feel guilty for sure. you know i could've been a better sister. better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better. and it's working <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: woo um i guess huh. hm. i don't know i mean. i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so. if i erase something then it just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and. i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean. you know i don't think i would change an event. you know i'm i'm okay with what. you know ups and downs and good and bad that has happened [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: so. yeah [Interviewer]: i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: uh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot um. but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like. even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and you know just find my way up to the top. you know somehow some way and just make it. you know um traveling. uh i would love to do that but. i don't know just you know. always circumstances in my life that. doesn't you know always something you know i'm

[Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: uh. it's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because. i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like ugh but eventually i do <laughter> you know i just i probably like need to. position myself on a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i gotta go to the other side and. once i position myself then i just like go to sleep you know. but it just i gotta find the position <pos> the right position for me. yeah [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. i'm tired <laughter> i get tired throughout throughout the day you know but. i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like. feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that i have as great as possible. you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of <laughter> you know. so yeah yeah yeah it's just [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: you know. it's okay i try to make it the best i guess. if not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks. but yeah [Interviewer]: okay have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh no <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no

reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and. oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time <laughter> i've never really like uh you know but yeah i've yeah very happy [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: uh [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. i don't know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like. you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really. you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me. to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. <laughter> nothing i think <laughter> um. like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am

for the likings of other people <laughter> i have only one body and one life so yeah [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: yeah that's it [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: uh. just my childhood with my sisters and my family but. you know it's you know i you learn from that. you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. just smile and be happy. you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know. the only thing you can't um. i don't know you can't. you know. go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going. yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um. i don't know um. that's pretty. huh most proud of. i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm. you know i try to be. you know. a better person each day and try to like. you know improve myself every day. as much as i can. you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know. as much as i can [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know. and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but. you know it's just it's it's sometimes. you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so yeah [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. you know. loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i don't know i guess that's what they say <laughter> i i just you know that's them like. you know but that's what at least what i try to be. you know at least i try to. give a the best foot forward always. as much as possible you know even. sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like uh you know. you know i just i don't wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: um <laughter> my ideal weekend. usually i i like going to the park. i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like. put my blanket out there have my dog and. like read a book and you know sometimes. if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know. just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the. noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: awesome [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: thank you you're welcome <laughter> [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: sure [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: pretty good [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: new york [Interviewer]: really when did you move to l_a [Patient]: uh i moved to l_a in the seventies [Interviewer]: that's a long time [Patient]: but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: of. um. i guess every few years but. i travel a lot so i've lived in. i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too [Interviewer]: wow what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: um different cultures food music rituals. uh. everything the smells the colors. makes you feel alive [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: excuse me [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: one of my trips [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say. i love horseback riding so when you're. uh viewing other animals when you're. kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great. seeing red orange fall sunsets and. riding along you know uh. seeing so many animals yeah [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: in kenya um. probably when i went to a. a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii. and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it. tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to. enter a masai village for the first time. uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same. twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai [Interviewer]: (laughter (laughter [Patient]: and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be. uh. some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed. my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets. and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah [Interviewer]: that's great do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: <sigh>. i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen. uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go. achieve it sometimes um i believe that. um. usually i well i make decisions very quickly. and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker. and i told him i said well in each case. you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's. hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one. and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy. mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure. even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time. and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy [Interviewer]: yeah yeah i see what you mean sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: uh pardon. you said you put your fish [Interviewer]: what do you do when you are annoyed [Patient]: what do i do when i'm annoyed [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: um <sigh>. <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um. i guess you really have to put yourself. in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're. put in other situations where you're forced to. to um. understand other people's. lives a lot more regardless of how different they are. uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why. travel is really the best education there is [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: <sigh> let me think um. <tisk> uh <sigh>. last time i argued about. something um. god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um. oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. uh <sigh>. oh i know what it was um. it was somebody who belonged to the uh. uh scientology faith um. i uh. inherited. i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus. and um. uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive. and um. <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited. and um. and he said something about are you aware of. past lives and. i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that. if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and i and he said that are you aware that. um. <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that. many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have. had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness. um resulting from even your past relationships or your. parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that. you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself. even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold. maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all. and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge. i take. sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would. fold down i had my boo boo. and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part. you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: and i would actually. even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back. i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital. the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that. just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh. um. uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that. because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and. it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was. um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen. twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have. never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know. so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of. somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his. uh. you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: uh the following week. and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get. into it but. one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused. by people themselves. and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that. past lives can also affect. you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are. are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought. he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so. but um. <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't. you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but other than that i mean i don't [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: <sigh> um. uh <sigh>. sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when. when it's in terms of patience [Interviewer]: mm tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital [Interviewer]: i'm sorry how did you decide to do that [Patient]: mm <sigh>. mm my brother. uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he. is in the medical field so my sister and i said well. you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time. but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after. you know my boss my father kept. you know um. um you know bucking the his body would actually. be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard. mm but you know it was after a while the uh. you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular. uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah it was mhm [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: hm. mm. i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic. that happened to me that i've. had to block them i really don't know what. it is within my makeup which. doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that. have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of. that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear. and for some reason i i feel blessed that i. don't really i can't really even think of something that. i mean i've had some. bad situations happen to me but. it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me. in affecting. you know my behavior where i would. where i block it that i'm not aware. of something or i hold residual. negativity for some reason so. i really can't think of anything i mean. there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to. block them 'cause i've been able to. you know um. accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just. kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so. i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but. say like if i'm in africa and i. <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my. elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem [Interviewer]: (laughter that's good how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: have i ever studied <s> studied what [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: um no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh uh [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this. past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: mm. you know it's funny. uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been. uh. um. opened up experiences that are. that are also great that i have not. overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner. to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and. sometimes people sat to me like. are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or. are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was. you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even. more difficult in a way um and uh. he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved. uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um. <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business. i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why. i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see. the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten. to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g>. german. uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off. but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed. during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life. uh. a different world that. that would you know that i would've never. um had the chance. you know to. live through if i had not involved my. you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who. you know money isn't everything and. i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so. there you go [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: <laughter> and for example one of my favorite. times in my life probably when i lived in kenya. and you would think that. you know a lot of people have this. really bad vision of it maybe looking living. in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of. uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have. you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best. years of my life when i was living in kenya [Interviewer]: mm that's so good to hear what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen. um. to. live your life with passion. and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about. making decisions. you have to make those decisions gut wise. what will. give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy. and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield. you know the happiness in your life [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: <tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and. follow my. passions and. you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually. decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is [Interviewer]: yeah okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: sure [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

technology things like that [Interviewer]: awesome are you still working in that [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: what do you do now [Patient]: right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera. so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to. performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily. so it's actually a pretty good gig [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that. do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>. so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people. but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family  . don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know. i'd rather keep to myself [Interviewer]: uh huh how close are you to your family [Patient]: uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: but like. thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and. you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: but it's. somewhat close [Interviewer]: okay what do you do to relax [Patient]: mostly i sing or i read or i write or. just. hang out and try to. clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just. clear everything and see what starts coming back in. and. sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things. um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: works but. mostly in my free time i create things [Interviewer]: okay do you travel a lot [Patient]: i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um. i mean my idea of. like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. and i like to travel more um. i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change . i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of . where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> [Interviewer]: <laughter> [Patient]: <laughter> <clears throat> [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um. let's see. xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line. um my cousin and i would take what we call. exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  . sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off. so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight. just small short trips that. aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how. um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so close to home but not. but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that. kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so i i like i like doing that [Interviewer]: i see what you mean cool when was the last time that happened [Patient]: the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that. we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am. and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live. so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas. and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda. i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there. and we came back and was. you know. an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: it was kind of an interesting [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  . and. i actually. like to see people who are. strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: or what have you. so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason. you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. just that kinda really just makes me mad [Interviewer]: uh huh okay what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  . you know verbally just. cutting 'em with a quip or. you know. i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody. but i'll try to you know. if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to. get them to leave me alone. um. so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction. and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: it's is trouble it's usually trouble that. it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of . so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh the last time i argued with somebody. like. person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: uh the last thing i can think of was. i. argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia. and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a. i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature. but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us. because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like. i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that. it. brings you. a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened. when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it . and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it. but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her. yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care. but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad. but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore. so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do. i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's. a dual effort it's very much a dual effort. but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like. a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but. lively discussion <laughter>. you know than debate [Interviewer]: i see that sounds really hard [Patient]: meh. it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever. and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy. but you deal with it and you you move on [Interviewer]: yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother. 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually. gave me a lot of confidence. and but were realistic about it. so i mean i think i have sort of a. realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life. and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   [Interviewer]: that's great is there anything you regret [Patient]: i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions. now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home. my focus was to get her home [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year. eating just horrible foods when i did eat. so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick . and i'm wondering well if i didn't. if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded. would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em. and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she . uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and. her health insurance provider missed that. so she wound up having [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: sort of this whole. catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke. and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her. and i know. there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her. if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have [Interviewer]: yeah do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself [Patient]: oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's. my desire to take responsibility. for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really. direct them into my own vision because they're their own. individual beings. and they can't you know. be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be. but i still have you know my ideals. and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too . fit into my life. in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings. and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs. and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: it's still. kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. ten or twenty years ago. probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she. got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside . the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so. i think i i probably would've done that. um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate. your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family. to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: ten years ago <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay have you ever served in the military [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know. and i mean it's not. i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances. and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. and of it gets <ge> [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: um. after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know. if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't. but. how could i convince myself of that. um two weeks after she died i wound up with. pulmonary embolisms. in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if. you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um. i mean i wound up having to take more medication. because of that. uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to. get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like. the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore . so. and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just. you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now. and it. it's been. a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up. just stay in bed and sleep all day you know. but then. realizing that. when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well. they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: i took that responsibility of doing it for them. so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: they didn't you know so. they eh they actually got me up and. and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them. if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been. you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably . and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for . for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is. to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  . as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but. i have a family to look after now . so i have to go out and do things  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  . but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  . been working on on a balance of the two [Interviewer]: how hard is that  [Patient]: very <laughter> but it's worth it. i mean . it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> . but keeping. a residence down paying bills things like that . it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and i and and i know that . but . it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up . but then . it's like well what's the alternative . i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life . 'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna . be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever . and i wouldn't get anything done  [Interviewer]: i see how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: uh very . anxious and nervous and i mean what if . i don't find . enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um . you know what what if i can't  . keep. a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but . what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs . and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that . but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in . so that's actually . a source of . anxiety . but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it . but i i i know it it's a cycle [Interviewer]: that's good  [Patient]: and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is. the fundamental thing i need to take of here . i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what. is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and so . figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit. but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again . mm i'll have to . uh . figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  . you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  [Interviewer]: yes when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: the last time i felt really happy. i don't know. zz. um. i . huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me . because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda. eh in the middle. um. really like overjoyously happy i don't know . i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened [Interviewer]: okay  how would your best friend describe you  [Patient]: i don't know you don't know . perceptions of other people i mean . probably as somebody who . oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know . handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  . at all. and it's a it [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities  [Patient]: probably that i can think on my feet and. i'm not afraid to . hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done . um that . and i can do it creatively and i try to . strive for balance . probably . probably the best things about me <laughter>  [Interviewer]: uh huh that's great what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not . um. you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to . who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got. a career that she . it's more of a job that she fell into . 'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  . but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and. she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda. stole all the money from her business so she lost her business  . and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  [Interviewer]: uh oh  [Patient]: she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it  . and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is . yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can . be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me . people i actually like in my life and . be happy with that . and i see a lot of people who aren't . and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now [Interviewer]: mhm that's so good to hear  okay i think i've asked everything i need to  [Patient]: thank you <laughter>. okay  [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  [Patient]: thank you <laughter> [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye

[Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach [Interviewer]: nice can you tell me about that [Patient]: yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um. this weekend is easter and we usually will go. down to easter <east> easter spring break. to rosarito baja [Interviewer]: aw what did you study at school [Patient]: um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: because it's a open field. just doesn't deal with um. communication interactively but performing arts. telecommunications. business entrepreneurship so [Interviewer]: mhm are you still working in that [Patient]: no i'm not i'm actually unemployed [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: um. i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area. as a business. something do online online services. um i like to make things with my hands. so my next venture would. would be to create all natural soy candles. something in that area [Interviewer]: awesome do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: um a mixture [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds. and that's how i usually make a determination if i. remain reserved or remain open [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk. or go get a massage [Interviewer]: that's good how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: fair [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning. um. usually the argument is about. me making myself clear. or me repeating myself twice [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: no it usually gets the other person in trouble [Interviewer]: (laughter tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: mm. i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission. and i had a warranty. and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs. and the guy offered me a portion of. the settlement agreement. and i decided to take him to small claims court. to get a bigger amount. and i wish i would've have. taken the offer that he gave me. at the midst of. dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs. and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing. the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion. so i wish i would've. taken the higher. road than taken the lower road [Interviewer]: i see what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hardest decision. uh i don't know financially emotionally [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: mm. emotionally letting go a past relationship. it's the hardest thing that i. i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: yes it was a relationship of seven years. but um that person has already moved on. so. uh they want me to be in their life. in hopes that. if something goes wrong with my current relationship. we'll always have something to fall back on [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: uh yeah it is hard [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um an event. something i could erase from my memory. um. i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events. that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: um. probably the death of a relative [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um alone and misinformed [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: because i didn't know that they were that sick. and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and i could've had more opportunity to. spend time with them and make. better a better connection in the last days [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um. it's fair to midland [Interviewer]: how close are you to your family [Patient]: mm. my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close [Interviewer]: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: my mother [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um yes uh she's encouraged me to. continue my education. to always fall back on my. hobbies hopes goals and dreams. she always encourages me to. always stay aloof and. out there looking for a better opportunity. and she encourages me to. not be afraid to. explore other ventures [Interviewer]: that's great how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: easy <laughter> easy <laughter> [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i've been feeling

horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic [Interviewer]: yeah do you travel a lot [Patient]: not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if

[Patient]: no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while. one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but [Interviewer]: awesome what's your dream job [Patient]: my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um. i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can. i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment [Interviewer]: mhm how hard is that [Patient]: um. i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult [Interviewer]: yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days [Patient]: yep [Interviewer]: what do you do now [Patient]: i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so. it's just basically i get sent out to do uh [Interviewer]: cool [Patient]: to do desk jobs  [Interviewer]: are you happy you did that [Patient]: um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so . you know yeah [Interviewer]: okay how close are you to your family [Patient]: i'm pretty close i mean they're around so [Interviewer]: hmm what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: um god really mad. stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me. um. that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all [Interviewer]: mhm can you give me an example of that [Patient]: um what's a good example. just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific. situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so [Interviewer]: right when was the last time that happened [Patient]: uh god. i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back [Interviewer]: i understand do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: what do you mean [Interviewer]: let's come back to that later [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: what do you do to relax [Patient]: god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym. listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so. anything of that sort i like. i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative [Interviewer]: awesome who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: who's been a positive <pos>. i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and. which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so. i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there [Interviewer]: like what [Patient]: you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently. instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time [Interviewer]: mmm that's good how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i guess it depends on who you talk to [Interviewer]: <laughter> [Patient]: i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that. um. i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me. but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress. lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better [Interviewer]: that's good have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you ever served in the military [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: okay is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. nothing major. i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean. those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know. but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but. but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so [Interviewer]: right there are always trade offs in life aren't there [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: so. um i think. i think my. in my life i knew that. i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with. so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of. mmm kind of answered itself so [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense. it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you [Interviewer]: right that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: memorable experiences um hmm. i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that. i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able. i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like. i've gotten somewhere [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: when was the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. when was the last time i really felt happy. um. i don't know i'm not really someone who's like. i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i. i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so. i guess to answer the question probably. mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy [Interviewer]: that's great how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends. i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty. determined. i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible. so. i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as [Interviewer]: okay okay i think i've asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: no problem [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: alright. bye

list i would like to get out of here um the. the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too  [Interviewer]: yeah yeah what'd you study at school [Patient]: i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology [Interviewer]: wow that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that [Patient]: i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it  [Interviewer]: nice what's your dream job [Patient]: everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling> . um i think maybe. managing a um managing a research. you know i'm not

about one of your trips [Patient]: well i traveled for eight months in central america. um and i visited a lot of different countries i. um i went scuba diving [Interviewer]: wow what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up [Interviewer]: mhm what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter> [Interviewer]: <laughter> yes how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um. to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control  [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting. getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um. we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight [Interviewer]: aww that's good what do you do to relax [Patient]: um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people  [Interviewer]: okay how close are you to your family [Patient]: i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh. couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground [Interviewer]: i see what you mean do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i. seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge  [Interviewer]: mhm how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend. um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal   [Interviewer]: that's great what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm. i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself . a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: have you ever served in the military [Patient]: no i have not [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago  [Interviewer]: you were very young weren't you [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um i was cutting and my. one of my best friends called. um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um. it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks  [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: <laughter> [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy's useful [Patient]: uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back [Interviewer]: yeah how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and. my routine of go to school. and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit . weird finding out what to do with my. finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um. depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california  [Interviewer]: yeah that sounds really hard how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um. about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep . sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep [Interviewer]: okay what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i. i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um. i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile [Interviewer]: i see when was the last time that happened [Patient]: probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens   [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: uh <makes sound with mouth>. really happy i mean um. i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's. really happy on new year's eve which was um. uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them. i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life [Interviewer]: that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults. um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and. i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn  [Interviewer]: okay what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really. amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this. uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in. something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this  [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so . that was that was pretty good <laughter>  [Interviewer]: awesome what are some things you like to do for fun [Patient]: i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um. just being together with my friends doing um. relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat [Interviewer]: okay is there anything you regret [Patient]: not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: hmm. um. i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion [Interviewer]: <laughter> what are some things that usually put you in a good mood [Patient]: hmm. um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature. kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter> [Interviewer]: cool who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's . really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that . uh really inspired me  [Interviewer]: that's great okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks

way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality [Interviewer]: mhm what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: <sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path. uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold

l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and. i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport. we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was. it was big monumental [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt powerful and excited and just open

[Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: hard. very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to [Interviewer]: mm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i would say outgoing on in general [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise. calming calming area and just. just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to. to come back to a calm neutral place [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: i am. getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm. good at controlling my temper.

tell me about that [Patient]: no. <laughter> hmm mm [Interviewer]: okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: argued with someone um. god. i guess it was a friend. a friend a girlfriend it. it wasn't it was about. uh our. our each separate perspectives on a. a certain situation between us that. were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is. this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: <sigh> hmm mm. i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that. it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it [Interviewer]: could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: mm. i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've. made the outcome much less. chaotic [Interviewer]: i see what you mean tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hmm. uh i guess that would be. hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and. kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for. sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and. i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that. you know you're not always gonna. feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good [Interviewer]: yeah are you happy you did that [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just. yeah [Interviewer]: i understand tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be. in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i

sleep [Patient]: it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've. come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: <sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm. in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and. uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and. just um sweat more just feel. feel um just a little off [Interviewer]: how have you

some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: my drive being more driven and just getting things done [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: mm i guess it would be well a recent. a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh. yeah sort of just. uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and. even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel. like

gather my thoughts. um i like to read. and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts. every once in a while. um when things are getting too chaotic. at my house um. and i'm feeling very underappreciated. i will. have a. burst of anger [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation. but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of. um recognizing that i'm upset about it. my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad. and then that escalates and. uh. sometimes i just end up walking out the door. or going to my room [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: hmm. i'm sorry [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: um i i usually after i have an outburst. and i isolate myself for a little bit. i can come back relaxed. and deal with the situation. in a. more. calm manner [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to. stop and and get myself out of there. and and go take some deep breaths. um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: why i'm being angry why why am i being. um. so tense. and then be able to verbalize that [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um. well i i it happens a few times when i start getting. i've had a very tense day. um and things haven't gone right. um. i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner. and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework. or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh. uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then. and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out. just let me finish dinner. and nobody would. and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up. and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to. pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: um so that that i i should have um. walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um. it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child. um i wasn't married. um <tisk> i had a very good friend. um. oh i was i was. thirty two at the time. so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion. but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this. um. and i had. um. i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to. um. but we'd only been dating like three months. and i was living with. a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with. um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well. um i didn't know if we could raise a child together. i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else. um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together. um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together [Interviewer]: aw [Patient]: um. and uh so it was a lot of. um. huge decisions. that were gonna determine the rest of my life. um. and i. made the decision based on. more common sense and practicality. um. but i don't regret that decision. i think i made a good decision [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: to marry my husband and. raise our child <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about your kids [Patient]: um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen. he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering. he is getting his pilot's license. uh which i'm very proud of him for. um then my daughter is. fifteen. and she loves acting. uh she um she has a boyfriend. who um. uh they see just once a week at church basically. um and they text each other constantly. um she's a very very typical fifteen year old [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: and then i have a twelve year old. he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly. um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house. so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis [Interviewer]: nice do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: no. i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't. my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young. and um my mother kind of disconnected. when that happened. um so i didn't have a very warm or loving. relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was. um kind of on my own from a very young age. um. i mean she was at the house but. really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have. parenting skills [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: that you know most people are are raised with. um. i know what not to do. but sometimes it's very difficult and um. i i see my friends that have you know these. very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect. um and it's like i i'm just not that person. so i i. i try and be. i'm i i think i am a very good mother. but i'm not um. a typical mother. i think i'm more. um i'm more creative. a lot of times i and we do a lot of things. um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: actually when we go camping it's more. i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home. i think i'm more tense when i'm at home. but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become. calmer and more patient. i think my patience is what. um i need to work on the most [Interviewer]: i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: i'm a been an insomniac all my life. i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and. um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise. and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day. i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired. to sleep well. um and that's sometimes that's hard to do. um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading. i'll read 'til midnight. um and then i'll try and go to sleep. um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again. and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: yesterday i didn't feel so good i was. um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday. um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard. um so i had some more planting to do. and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it. um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good. so i feel more positive i feel more energy [Interviewer]: that's good have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: so. no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that. hasn't really helped me sleep. but um. it was really good because i needed one for a really long time. and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane. um but it was. you know just like. i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's. it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing. and it was like finally. uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list. um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and. uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy [Interviewer]: that's great how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: <laughter> i don't know um. i think she. believes that i'm. uh. uh. more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am. at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues. uh. she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice. um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me. um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by. uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: um or empathetic and. uh i just i'm just there to listen. and i don't need to give her any advice so. i think a a good listener and. good advice giver [Interviewer]: okay what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: i procrastinate a lot. um i start projects and i don't finish them. uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and. um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get. almost finished. and then. i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest. um. sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them. which sounds a little strange but. um. i i'm working on that. i'm trying to get those done [Interviewer]: okay is there anything you regret [Patient]: oh gosh <laughter> um. not following through on the opportunities i had when. i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree. um. with on a grant and things of that sort um. but instead i got pregnant and got married. and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed. um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time. where i had to fight for a directorship. and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship. and so i really wish so i resigned. um. and i wish i had stuck with that. um. 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and. solid career [Interviewer]: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: um. not. base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses. um the jobs were wonderful. um. but. my ego got in the way. and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the. the. egotistical. reactions that i had. to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um my children actually. um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal. um and. uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that. they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl. my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started. and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day. and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it. um so that's. that was. one of my prouder. experiences [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear okay i think i have asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: okay. thank you [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye

lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people lot more going on [Interviewer]: how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a [Patient]: um i'm still <st> i guess i'm still getting used to it so. um. it's. it's not like um. yeah i'm still getiing used to it it's it's coming slowly but but surely [Interviewer]: okay where do you live [Patient]: i live in culver city [Interviewer]: do you have roommates [Patient]: i do i have one [Interviewer]: how do you like your living situation [Patient]: uh it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's uh it's cheap <chea> it's cheap 'cause i'm living in a friend's place. um. and uh. but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so [Interviewer]: oh no that's good i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: i can't see your shoes actually. uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: i enjoy the chance to get to like see other. um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the. the specificity of my own. you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um. i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: i see what you mean i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: uh okay um. hmm. putting me on the spot here ellie [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: um. let's see. uh. well um i. it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess. one of the last trips i did was to um. i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw. but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole. like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally. it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um. unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so. so um. uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: hmm. it's a tough question um. one <on> um. <makes clicking sound with mouth>. i uh. hmm. you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: yeah. come back to it [Interviewer]: let's come back to that later [Patient]: yeah. that's what i just said [Interviewer]: what did you study at school [Patient]: film [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know. i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys. and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls. um. and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and. at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um. like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in. playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film. like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always. i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: um. and uh and i never. uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was. fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars. the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: i'm not really sure uh. yeah it's it's it's. um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film. but. uh i've always been fascinated by like. how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general [Interviewer]: are you still working in that [Patient]: i am yes [Interviewer]: i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job [Patient]: um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct. and uh put <pu> put together. and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make. movies. uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the. all the processes but [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: i guess the best parabole for that would be a director. directing [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them. um. my. i guess um. it's funny you should ask ellie um. i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't. when away. like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like. i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like. of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like. um thinks positively about me. um so it's i have like a. a complicated relationship with my parents. i mean <mea> and my family in general [Interviewer]: mhm do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like. um. i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like. uh. or inhibited person maybe um. so i like to like. until. yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it [Interviewer]: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed. so now i you know i have a glass of wine and. maybe watch a movie. um. i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um. if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like. then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might. go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like. you know competitive sports and hiking [Interviewer]: yeah how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: pretty good [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: well i always like arguing um. i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper. um. i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um. but i don't. as long as my like. 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks. uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: um. and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think. um. one of my weaker points i would say. but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: um [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: hmm. the last time i had a heated debate. was um i had a heated debate about. uh the movie boogie nights. um. i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about. 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the. like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie [Interviewer]: why yes [Patient]: um. they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um. they have a certain uh they think that the. like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like. complexity of character within the movie. and um. that somehow like. <sigh> um. what what were they saying they were saying like the movie. it like xxx it's like the end of an era. which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they. how they interact in the plot. um. kind of like. uh. yeah i guess. i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's. the um. i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i. i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like [Interviewer]: mm [Patient]: in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it. um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool. um. the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but. but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie. and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like. so in the movie django unchained. um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big. the. big purpose of the movie is [Interviewer]: right [Patient]: and um. and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh. who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he. was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django. or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera. and um. and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not. sacrifice themself for someone else [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like. um. like who. uh like. she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that. altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist. um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself. um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like. every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um. purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate. um. and uh. somewhat like yeah and it's it uh. so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um. i think of losing my temper as being more. um. like i just. so <s> i i would so <s>. revert to um ad hominem like attacks. uh but i i didn't like that's not um. maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like. well you're an idiot. you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: yeah i'm glad you understand. <deep breath> [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments. not. stories um. like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: the hardest decision i've ever had to make. oh geez. could it just be one of the hardest decisions [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: hmm. um. like choosing between two things that it's like. i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between. two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life. but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: and uh but i had to do it. for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends. were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world. and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't. i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think. it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back. to new york within like a month or two. uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could. leave new york [Interviewer]: i see how hard is that [Patient]: it was how hard was that. or how hard is [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: how hard was that. um. it was hard. <laughter> um. it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like. isolating isolating <is>. 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends. and uh. that had kind of gone extremely. badly. and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole. everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of. saw it at the time so i didn't like. you know just being socially isolated etcetera [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: well recently it's been awful. um. i uh. i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours. um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams. but previous to that night. so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep. um because i was working on set and i would get back. and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um. too much riled up energy or something i i don't know [Interviewer]: mm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: tired uh. very. not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning. and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so. um. i guess. with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go. um without caffeine it's. i'm just i'm just quieter i guess [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: more introverted [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: since. like lately as in when [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: um. change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like. eh at the beginning where the. the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends. and the the push to. to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um. overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like. coming to terms with that um. and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just. you know. you you know <sigh> you know <sigh> [Interviewer]: that's good have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no i just [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: nope [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: the last time i felt really happy. might have to reach back. um. i think the last time i felt really happy. was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie. um co-wrote co-directed co-produced. um. and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the. writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up. eat breakfast. bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative. full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and. and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like. just like. i felt like it yeah i guess that was the. the last time that was that was like. eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: it's too much else to do so [Interviewer]: that makes sense what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: i would say that i'm very. accepting <acce> like. accepting of other people. and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um. and. open <o> open <ope> like. excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and. yeah um [Interviewer]: okay what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: hmm. um. i guess i wish i was less uh. uh. less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my. you know. everyday interactions and in my like. um. you know. zest for for living. um <sigh> yeah i xxx. i other things i would change about myself i'd. i would. i don't know <laughter> [Interviewer]: um tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: hmm. really badly about myself. um. <sigh>. i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like. uh. like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um. some sort of uh. conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always. always on the other side of the court you know like never. it was i i noticed. or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were. like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with. like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which. um i was like blamed or like you know. it was my it was my fault um when. when what i was doing like. yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like. there's no yeah i don't know [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: ten years ago um. stay stake you know like i i think that there's um. i have a tendency to. like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes. um. ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't. don't decide that you um. are only going to do. one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes. um. as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't. it's only now that i um i don't know i guess. stay uh. don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: that's it [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: sure [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: goodbye. bye
[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday [Interviewer]: aw that's great where are you from originally [Patient]: california [Interviewer]: really [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: what are some things you really like about l_a [Patient]: um the beach [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i love the waters [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: the gang violence. violence [Interviewer]: okay can you tell me about that [Patient]: um i lost a lot of friends growing up in. um through elementary and high school. just losing them through gang violence [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: yeah thank you. it was pretty tough out there <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot [Patient]: um. haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really [Interviewer]: okay what did you study at school [Patient]: um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician. and i also have my associate's degree [Interviewer]: that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um actually i went in. i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied. i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful. um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything. um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i. i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats [Interviewer]: what's your dream job [Patient]: to be a optometrist [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step. and um what i why is a good question it's because. then i would have a be able to have my own business. and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter. and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a. a family business but a a to help the community as well. and something i could leave for my daughter [Interviewer]: that makes sense tell me about your kids [Patient]: uh my daughter she's five years old. uh she'll be starting elementary school next week. and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is. very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um. she's adorable she's my heart [Interviewer]: do you find it easy to be a parent [Patient]: no. this is like the hardest job ever <laughter> [Interviewer]: what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: it's very hard. providing. providing uh making sure that. you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough. to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and. i'm a little more mature than her father so. it's um. it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so. complicated let alone um. it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um. even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party. and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to. make sure that she has a good day so. it's all about uh going the extra mile. doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job [Interviewer]: yeah what's the best thing about being a parent [Patient]: um. that moment of the day. when your child tells you how much they care about you. and um. my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and. how many. i mean just call your name it just. it's a sense of reality um. to be called mom or to call call dad and. it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and. it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: thank you [Interviewer]: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: um. a lot of different things i'm actually. taking care of my daughter <laughter> um. i'm here with her uh. i was raised by my grandparents so. i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and. my father i mean i couldn't point him out. on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so. i feel that um. i'm very different from them because. no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. i guess i. there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive. in my life i can say. um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field. she's in the uh she's an l_v_a. and um she's one of my older sisters. um i can say. me believing in god. being in my life god being in my life has. also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and. um. hm. i don't know. i don't really look up to a lot of different people because. people lie so. and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy. um coming up as a kid and. i don't know i don't know what happened to me. uh one day i just broke out of my shell and. i've been um. very accurate of. showing my personality off <laughter> [Interviewer]: (laughter sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. i actually like. for. the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach. and i like to just sit there. and just zone out everybody else that's there. and rub my toes in the sand. and that is so relaxing [Interviewer]: mm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um <yawning>. excuse me sorry about that um. i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's. and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper. is showing that i'm in charge of my life. so i don't even let stuff get to me. i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the.  the negativity [Interviewer]: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: mm probably my husband <yawning>. my daughter's father um. uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh. physical altercation like with another human being no [Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: wow. um being honest. i kind of feel guilty. about how things like uh basically how things ended. um before my mom passed i wish that. i could've. helped her a little more. even though people tell me not to feel bad. um because she wasn't really there for me growing up. but i kind of feel guilty like you know. not being there as much as i could've been for her. before she passed away so. i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for [Interviewer]: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. going through my mom passing away [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um. i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um. basically that. it was i felt kind of. robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and. i grew up with my grandparents and then. for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad. for

attitude. which is everybody's friendly and gets along and. and. let's see. i've been back and forth across this country at least. sixteen to twenty times so. yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: <laughter>. uh arkansas. little rock. where i had to get into a uh. you might wanna say a a altercation. with the rednecks down there because as as you know um. i'm african american. and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh. uh southern uh uh. uh. which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh. what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks. or any other culture besides whites aren't uh. valuable people [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out. but i'm okay [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time. on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know. i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and. i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so. at clubs i'm more outgoing. in social events more shy [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know

girlfriend <laughter> uh. we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago. because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do. and she wanted to do it anyway

i just take it in stride and and move on [Interviewer]: mhm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: uh. well it's it's probably it's. no one no no situation actually can be. i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it. after the fact. but uh. i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up. i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered. and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and. uh. not being able to communicate. with another person on the level of. of. understanding [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision

dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt   . um . or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep . but i uh <sigh>. i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me . because of stuff that've happened to me  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: so um . i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  [Interviewer]: okay  what are you like when you don't sleep well  [Patient]: um . tired . i'm uh . i'm moody i'm very sensitive . um . i uh i'm just

you cope with them  [Patient]: um . i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um . just to keep myself involved . um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can . um by running around and and and doing things . so  [Interviewer]: mhm how hard is that  [Patient]: um it's difficult . um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna . i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh . i make appointments to like for auditions or or um . even to do this i um i i tend to uh . just not . like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   [Interviewer]: yeah  i see have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: yes  [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed  [Patient]: um i've been diagnosed for two instances . um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago . and then i was diagnosed again um in august [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help  [Patient]: um . the first time it was um . i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  . and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  [Interviewer]: uh huh  [Patient]: um . and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um . and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore . so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  [Interviewer]: yeah  that sounds really hard  [Patient]: yeah . it was  [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: i no <n> do not [Interviewer]: why did you stop  [Patient]: um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um  [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just  [Interviewer]: i'm sorry to hear that  [Patient]: they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: yeah so um . yeah  [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately  [Patient]: <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy  [Interviewer]: that's good  when was the last time you felt really happy  [Patient]: um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that  [Patient]: um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um  [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear  [Patient]: yeah . thank you <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life  [Patient]: oh geez. um . i've had so many years of just . just bad just a lot of bad . that it there has it's been a long time . since i've been proud of anything . i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: is there anything you regret [Patient]: ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago  [Patient]: <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  [Interviewer]: yeah  [Patient]: so if [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so  [Interviewer]: i see what you mean  [Patient]: yeah  [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad  [Patient]: <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um . people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy. um. just anybody who picks on the little guy . um . you know people who don't care about the environment or animals. um  [Interviewer]: mhm [Patient]: i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be . and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do . and uh i that makes me mad  [Interviewer]: yeah  okay  what do you do when you're annoyed  [Patient]: <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore [Interviewer]: that's good  how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and come back to it  [Interviewer]: okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about  [Patient]: um . it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um . it was about um . actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her . and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um . i was i was tired um i was it was late and um . i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um . and you <yo> <sigh>. it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  . um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue . mm kinda petty and stupid but . at the time it it seemed . it seemed uh . viable  [Interviewer]: yeah  what's one of your most memorable experiences  [Patient]: um . hmm.

being a parent [Patient]: it's so spontaneous. like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and. just brings a smile to your face [Interviewer]: can you give me an example of that [Patient]: um. well when my son was younger. once we were just sitting around the house and. he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me. mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails. so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen. that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore. <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay what's the hardest thing about being a parent [Patient]: the hardest thing <sigh>. not wanting to screw it up. i feel a lot of stress and pressure. that. every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter. in what kind of person my kid turns out to be. and. so. it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter> [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself [Patient]: yeah. <laughter>. definitely [Interviewer]: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [Patient]: um. hmm. i think. i'm different from my mom. because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction. i welcome it you know i welcome. getting to know who my child is right now. and. not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just. see them become the best. child that they can be the best adult that they can be without. molding them in that direction necessarily [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: into a different person <laughter> [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: so [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: say it again [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: who's someone that's a positive influence [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: um <sigh>. mm. i don't really have anybody. like that [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: well. i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it. often enough. um. i've tried. to like go for walks but i don't always do that. and i don't always stick with it. <laughter>. so [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: yeah that's about it [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: <sigh>. i'd say. i'm. a little below average meaning. that i get angry. more than most people do i think [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: hmm. last night. <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband. um we have my sister lives with us. and she lives with us in a very small room with. a small apartment i should say. and she's got four people living in in one room so um. it's kind of stressful it's really crowded. and my husband is stressed out about it. and. you know i'm just saying to him that. i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here. then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do. that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded. and every day they're asking for rides and my husband. he's. avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore. and i'm just saying that. he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because. he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>. hmm [Interviewer]: that sucks [Patient]: it does <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: oh. i've got tons of 'em but right now. what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son. um. right now like. i've been arguing with my stepmom. and. my stepsister for a long time about. my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated. like they don't have any boundaries. and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child. they let my child boss 'em around and stuff. anyways because of this. they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that [Interviewer]: oh no [Patient]: yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom. because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different. ideas about child raising. she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife. and. she's. she really doesn't she's really far removed from. how i was raised and i wanna raise my child. more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us. and. with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild. and have everything that he wants. and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes. and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules. and not. trying to go and break all of my rules. <sigh> anyway <laughter> [Interviewer]: right that makes sense [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: um in that moment <sigh>. just really frustrated because they don't listen to me. i feel. disrespected i feel. like invisible. i feel. just angry. that. they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do. i went to school and i studied child development. i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>. i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities. and. to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent. try and tell me that i'm a bad parent. it's really. uh. hard to believe so i feel very disrespected. um. unacknowledged angry frustrated. all those things <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah i'm sorry how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um. i take i take benadryl to help me sleep. and i'm. so. <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep. and last night i was crying. before i went to sleep. so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed. but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily. <laughter> [Interviewer]: hmm are they triggered by something [Patient]: yeah i'm always thinking about my son. how i wish he was with me. and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>. and like i don't deserve. to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom. you know. <sobbing> [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: and i'm too hard on myself so. but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom. i just. i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me. and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because. i know he can do more for him. financially than i could. but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom. <laughter>. hmm [Interviewer]: yeah how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants. um. i take wellbutrin. i been on them for a couple weeks now. i think they're working i don't know. i'm not as. down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so. not that bad [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um <sigh> hmm. my husband complains a lot he says. i'm not the same person. that i was when he married me. he said i was fun and i was positive and. i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>. and. i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago. and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such. a shock. and um. i've just been trying to get back from it. but it's been hard [Interviewer]: i understand did you think you had a problem before you found out [Patient]: did i think i had a problem before i found out. found out what [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms [Patient]: oh. um. yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but. like um. my family would invite me. to family events. and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle>. or um. i don't know. it's just all the crying i think. and like i said my husband. letting me know that i'm not the same person. so. he's disappointed. and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too. another thing i'm feeling bad about. you know. <crying> [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: yes i do i try [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: do i feel like the therapy's useful. um. yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week. so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>. um. that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards. um [Interviewer]: that's good [Patient]: yeah. and she helps me make decisions you know. help me to be more proactive in my life [Interviewer]: mhm like what [Patient]: um. well. i'm looking for. jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that. you know and then she said something about. why don't you go back to school and. so i went and applied to go back to school. you know i'm not doing. much with my life and. sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either. so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college. in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills. so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas. that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing [Interviewer]: that's good right [Patient]: with life life yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: everything's always. bittersweet. um. i don't know. last time i was really happy. i don't know <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me how you spend your ideal weekend [Patient]: my ideal weekend. oh. i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent. reading maybe. but i can't really. i. i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading [Interviewer]: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: something i've read. xxx [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: okay. i like to go to u_s_c. they have these nights where. they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices. so i like to go out to <t> to their events. and i usually enjoy those [Interviewer]: awesome when was the last time that happened [Patient]: um. about two weeks ago. um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for. a discovery of witches. and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: and see what it's like to be an author who's. talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter> [Interviewer]: mhm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: my son. <laughter> [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: i don't have any friends [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: my best qualities. um. <sigh>. i'm smart. i'm good-looking. um. i'm really um. and like a hard worker. i i'm dedicated to like

[Patient]: totally [Interviewer]: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um. <makes sound with mouth>. i uh. i i um. no regrets no <laughter> um <laughter>. i guess. hmm. i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but. uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off. and. i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago. um it was just one of those days where i just didn't want. or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot. and. actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off. and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh. and then flip me off. so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off. and and she said oh you know i'm. i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know. i didn't need to be petty like that but i just. i wanted to be i guess [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep. <laughter> um. oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh. telling her i was gay. i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she. she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be. but it was just hard in the moment to. you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: um. when i was a little kid my um. my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road. and he uh. scrubbed_entry. and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just. uh like seeing death like that really just. threw me off and. uh frightened me and. uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad. and uh. it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: my relationship with my family is pretty good um. we're probably not as close as most but uh we. you know we always. we don't talk often but we talk with love and we. always love each other when we see each other [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me. to uh you know pursue my dreams and. not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her [Interviewer]: uh huh how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: usually it's easy um sometimes it's not [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week. but. while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like. my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like. fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven. so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty. and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half. when i should be. i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but. still wanna stay up i guess [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh. i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and. so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter> [Interviewer]: mm how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because. um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um. but. yeah. i think that answers the question [Interviewer]: okay have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: um i just that maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: mm mm [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um a couple days ago when i got my new job <laughter> when i got hired [Interviewer]: that's great how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um. outgoing listening. uh attentive. um. fun. loyal [Interviewer]: uh huh [Patient]: i think. i hope [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um i wish that i. uh i probably wish that i looked better i wish i had more hair up here mm losing it a little bit. uh probably wish i was a little skinnier this. this girdle's pretty tight <laughter> and um. you know sometimes i wish i had more money but. nothing too drastic. i'm okay [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: oh um. mm hmm when i was a little kid. i was uh i was the fat <f> i was the fat kid. and um. gosh i remember i was like i

more about that  [Patient]: um i had a different option to live with somebody else. and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever  [Interviewer]: mm i'm sorry to hear that [Patient]: that's fine [Interviewer]: how do you know them [Patient]: how do i know who. i [Interviewer]: let's come back to that later [Patient]: yeah <laughter> [Interviewer]: what are some things

sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago [Interviewer]: <laughter> how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all [Interviewer]: mhm can you tell me about that [Patient]: um. just her getting into grown folks' business and. it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said. and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter>  [Interviewer]: oh my gosh [Patient]: and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people. that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that [Interviewer]: yeah that sucks [Patient]: yeah so but i mean we're fine now. so that's good [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: to not . believe people so easily. so gullible to not be so gullible [Interviewer]: hm okay tell me more about that [Patient]: i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um. yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances . so [Interviewer]: hm [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my

it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of

that's good [Interviewer]: yeah can you give me an example of that [Patient]: scrubbed_entry. so that was a really bad time for us [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard what do you think of today's kids [Patient]: um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh. i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now. i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a . uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think. you know kind of uninspired right now [Interviewer]: yeah i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy [Interviewer]: do you feel that way often [Patient]: um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: oh gosh about a couple weeks ago [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you [Interviewer]: mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um just stressed. yeah stressed more stressed [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: do you feel down [Patient]: um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested [Interviewer]: yeah have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: uh not depression [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and. i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know [Interviewer]: mhm i'm sorry to hear that what got you to seek help [Patient]: um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law. and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow. there is a xxxx [Interviewer]: hmm [Patient]: back back [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms [Patient]: just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me . and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again. you know [Interviewer]: yeah have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now. and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question [Interviewer]: do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened. so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always. the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah [Interviewer]: yeah could you have done anything to avoid it [Patient]: i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh. uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life [Interviewer]: yeah do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can. effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself. that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh. you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school. yeah [Interviewer]: yeah how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: uh just. like a lot of work had a good ending. uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled. you know that and she was able to make that success [Interviewer]: that's great when was the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: wow um [laughter]. i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the

[Interviewer]: okay what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: um. i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um. like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad. but regret is like. um feeling like you should've made a different decision and. i think that can help you in. to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter> [Interviewer]: yeah is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school. um. uh. i mean not getting better grades. um. i regret uh. like getting involved with certain people in the past. but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter>. that's about it that i can think

mother but i mean we get along well. and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends [Interviewer]: that's good who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um. hm. i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life. uh. because she was always able to provide for me and she always. she didn't i mean she made. like mistakes sometimes but i

before you found out [Patient]: um. i'm not sure <laughter> [Interviewer]: what were your symptoms [Patient]: uh. i'm <laughter> i don't know [Interviewer]: is going to a therapist helping you [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how has seeing a therapist affected you [Patient]: um. it's helpful to uh. talk someone and have them kind of. um. guide you in. talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your. feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about

show that i like. um. just. kind of have like a relaxing time but. that's nice [Interviewer]: mhm what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: mm. i would tell myself to uh. to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever. and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like. sort of lose interest and then. uh not do well. or as well as i could have. so i would tell myself to. do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more. than i do. and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school. so i would just tell myself to do good in school. probably warn myself about one or two people that. turned out to be not worth my time <laughter> [Interviewer]: mm what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: um. hm. um. i think i am. proud of myself for not. being um. bitter and for wanting. to. uh. well i am

um. the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having. um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um. having trouble with tolerating cold. and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do. and i also was sick with the flu. um and in the past week i decided um. that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um. getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um. not isolating so much. and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing. i've been

depressants as well. and even though i've struggled with some bouts of. depression it's never been anything. extremely severe and um it was. one of the best things that ever happened [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: well um i was physically ill. with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person. um because he had cured her of that disease and. um. that was um. he treats multiple issues and so. everything is interrelated so um. once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i was so happy. um i felt like i some um. i felt that. i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh. that um. <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i. i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally. found. the answer to the. solution that i was looking for i was like. it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made. i felt. extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time [Interviewer]: that's great tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: <laughter> um i went to um. i went to a music store. because uh i had been thinking about. um taking up an instrument i used to play. the violin as a child and uh. i've been wanting to do something. that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed. and um. and so i went to the music store to try out. um to see what it would feel like to. um. to handle an the instrument again. . and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue [Interviewer]: awesome [Patient]: it was awesome <laughter> [Interviewer]: tell me how you

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: okay so how are you doing today [Patient]: doing pretty good [Interviewer]: that's good where are you from originally [Patient]: oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven. and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a. californian <laughter> [Interviewer]: cool what did you study at school [Patient]: uh i'm a welder [Interviewer]: how did you decide to do that [Patient]: um. i just. i don't know something about. it making and um building things and repairing things that. intrigued me and. uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession [Interviewer]: that's great what's your dream job [Patient]: <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just. uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh. i was satisfied with that [Interviewer]: i understand tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old. and uh. other than my wife i don't have any more family. um he passed away last uh july. and uh i'm. starting to get over it. um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so. i've been depressed about that and uh. uh but i'm doing better [Interviewer]: that's good that's good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: it depends on the atmosphere um. if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm. kinda reserved. but uh. if i'm comfortable. and uh. i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing [Interviewer]: mhm sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: <laughter>. <laughter>. right. i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and. i try to pick a movie that's uh. from back then people were different than they. uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it [Interviewer]: awesome how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: <sigh> well. my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but. uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper. and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about. but um. i'm working on it and. uh. i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: oh yes <laughter> [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh. <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter. but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young. uh follows you for the rest of your life and. i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices [Interviewer]: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: uh me and my wife we. we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree. and it's. she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh. uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is. a determined strong willed woman and <sniff>. i am who i am so. we kinda go back and forth and. lately i have been the one to <sigh>. bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run. it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed. and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and. having an ego bigger than my common sense and um. that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh. i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um. getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but. when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and. <sniff>. if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so. i. you know ran where. people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble [Interviewer]: uh huh tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: hardest decision i ever had to make was. giving the authorization to. um. have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed. <sigh> and um. doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him. <sigh> go through any suffering. to. let him slip away. and as you can see i get very upset my uncle. raised me like his own son and. never let me down. <sniff> and he's gone and. for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff>. but as i said i'm getting over it and um. things are getting better slowly [Interviewer]: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself. um <coughs> we enjoy. uh uh doing simple things. it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company. uh we like the same things and uh we. you know occasionally go out and do something together but we. <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she. like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes [Interviewer]: that's so good to hear [Patient]: mhm [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: you know. <sigh>. lately. well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do. a rigorous activity or something that. really uh stresses me or strains my body. it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much. i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours. i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but. i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep. i'll stay up all day and. i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but. you know for me i'm. it doesn't affect me [Interviewer]: hmm how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um. uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life. but um <sniff>. i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content [Interviewer]: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately [Patient]: yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um. recently well i can't say recently this was back in january. um. my wife and a few uh friends were. noticing that i was um. becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things. i i didn't see it and um. you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to. but anyway i went to the doctor and um. they gave me the tests. and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh. i've. over the last month or so. nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but. the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me. um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but. um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh. it it could've been due also i was told by him. uh. because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and. so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: i'm sorry [Interviewer]: how do you cope with them [Patient]: i'm not understanding you i'm sorry [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: how <h. no no i have not [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: two thousand one [Interviewer]: what got you to seek help [Patient]: um. i was. in a um. uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff>. i was in a um. in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help. um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder. uh worrying and thinking too much about things and. uh thinking the worst and uh. i i take medication for that [Interviewer]: do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's. <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor. are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter>. it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so. it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that. um. you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but. you know. it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would. i would do something the medication works for me [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: <sigh>. last time i felt real happy. well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um. i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff>. when i'm outside of that circle. i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content. i'm not. um. i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so [Interviewer]: that makes sense how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: well um <sniff>. i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff>. well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>. she would um. describe me as uh. i don't think before i speak. um i um. let the littlest insignificant things. bother me and i get angry over. but the big things it's like. i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um. uh <vocal fry> years and years ago. um. she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender. and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby. and i <sigh>. you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought. <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: and uh she goes you know you. you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money. you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care. so. that's the only way i can explain it [Interviewer]: mm what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle. um. i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life. and i'm finding it a little bit harder. um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power. to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or. you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were. a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a. scrubbed_entry. uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more. i guess it's we're a little bit older now and. <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh. i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh> [Interviewer]: okay is there anything you regret [Patient]: <sigh> uh lately. no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff>. everything's been fine the. like i say the. the biggest. biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever. in a hundred years or ever thought that i would. face that. situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but. they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter> [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: don't listen to other people. uh. again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh. he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they. um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think. they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems. um. i wish i could've changed some things um. <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody. and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do. uh i don't miss them but. if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made [Interviewer]: what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff>. uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat>. uh people that i know say that i'm uh. well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh. restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but. i've been told that. once or twice but i i've kind of. i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but. i just don't feel the motivation no more. i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter> [Interviewer]: okay i think i

you travel a lot [Patient]: um i don't currently but i did throughout my life i traveled. quite a lot [Interviewer]: what do you enjoy about traveling [Patient]: uh just seeing. seeing. other cultures and. seeing um more history and. meeting  people and. just fun and the the fun of it as well [Interviewer]: mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um let's see well one trip. i went to. england. ireland and scotland and france all in. you know. one trip. so that was a nice variety [Interviewer]: nice what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. i guess you could say probably skiing. in val d'isere france. that was fun. i'm glad i got to do that [Interviewer]: that's great do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: i'm kind of shy by nature. i've tried to grow out of being shy so. i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy. child. but now here in culver city this is my. environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in. in my hometown of culver city [Interviewer]: yeah sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: hm. to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap. watch t_v. sometimes on the couch in the living room. just you know stay at home and. kinda vegetate [Interviewer]: mhm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: hm. probably with my. husband. and. i can't remember at the moment what it was about [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: um well when you say my family do you mean. my  family from childhood or my current family [Interviewer]: whatever comes to your mind [Patient]: okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters. and. my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh. you know. going they're going through a lot of hormones and. um. they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship. um and then there's the husband which. i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter>. we need to get a divorce but we're still together. due to financial reasons. and yeah [Interviewer]: okay [Patient]: yeah so that that's not good the. the relationship with the husband but um. but since we have determined that we need to divorce. our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: hm. well. i guess. our marriage. i wish i had noticed early on that. you know it was like way off from what i thought it was [Interviewer]: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um <sigh> let's see oh my god. hardest decision. i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: um well you know we were married and i wasn't. content i guess you could say. um and. i kinda just. gave up on our relationship and. i i now that i look back i think it's because. i wanted. children and he would've been happy to never have any. and so uh since i didn't have a father. it was very important. that i. create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. and so i was kind of. at a age where i needed to start thinking about. having children. yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that. i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just. felt like. <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and. so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and. <tisk> um. <tisk> and i had to leave him. because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause. you know. i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter>. <laughter> but um. it was. hard. to leave him [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: mm. something i wish i could erase from my memory. i have to think about that. i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well. yeah there's um. i guess it'd be nice to erase. from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event. in my. recent adulthood here in culver city. where one of my best friends. um. i've betrayed me by. back years ago when my husband first got into real estate. she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home. and. um. we just assumed that you know that they would use. my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time. and purchase a new home. <tisk> and as it turned out. they surprised us and. had been talking to this other local agent. and uh yeah. that was devastating. i don't think i had ever  been betrayed. like that. so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young. and um. my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say. six maybe. um. maybe five. anyway her <h>. her and my best friend's. daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other. we were pregnant together. and um. they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd. run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were. just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her. their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together. and they're still very connected in fact <laughter>. she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter. and another girl. and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now. these girls are. becoming really good friends better friends. um. and yet. i still have this. vivid. um. bad memory. of what her. her mom did to. to me [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: that was about what. ten. about eight years ago. anyway. <sigh> i tried to i tried to [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: ignore it and put it out of my head and. which i've been able to <sniff>. in recent years. but obviously it still comes up [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: anyway that that was that [Interviewer]: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: <sniff>. um not that easy. i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but. sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up. and can't get back to sleep. uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that. that difficult thing [Interviewer]: are they triggered by something [Patient]: well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter>. and then um. <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom. so i guess that's the trigger. as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there. i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind. running through my mind and the day. i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so. it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to. i guess [Interviewer]: okay what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. well i'm kinda used to it now. so i just go on. through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um. i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do. and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have. huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something. read my book watch t_v watch whatever [Interviewer]: mhm how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: lately how have i been feeling um. kind of down. on myself down on life [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: well i have this pending. need <n> need for separation slash divorce. um. <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers. you know on the verge of adulthood. <clears throat>. and so i worry that. you know. i did all kinds of things wrong. with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late. um. like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things. uh. and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life. i know i wanna do something i i. i just wish. you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff. so i i regret that extremely. and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to. divorce and move on with my life. so. now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter>. um. that's the state. part of the state of my life [Interviewer]: okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: how long ago were you diagnosed [Patient]: mm <tisk>. well. the first time or or or recently [Interviewer]: yes [Patient]: the first time i guess was. you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little. upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then. i was um. <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i. you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him. and i didn't understand this feeling. i was really upset. how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really. recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i. had the. knowledge or the. i was able to. take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour. and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me. and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as. i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know. um. yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed. and put on meds. that was probably about. two years ago [Interviewer]: mm do you still go to therapy now [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: why did you stop [Patient]: um money i i don't have insurance. otherwise yeah i'd be happy to. go to therapy <laughter>. anything that might help [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: ooh <laughter>. boy. last time i felt really happy. um. i don't know i guess maybe. when my children were born. that's [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: <laughter>. um. i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know. i always wanted children so it was nice. to have them. that's. i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed [Patient]: <sniff>. mm. something i did that i really enjoyed. well. let's see i um. friday night i went to a friend's house. and met up with. five other girlfriends and we. we created vision boards. and talked and. had dinner. at one of their house that was that was fun [Interviewer]: that sounds like a great situation [Patient]: yeah. we get to [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: ooh <sigh>. stay in college get my degree. um. get therapy try to become a happy. um. yeah try to figure out things earlier in life. like. yeah. stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like. as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the. songs go you know. it's all about money the world revolves around money and. having none. that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life. having no money. is. you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. so. with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree. and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it. um. don't quit. to go traveling you know. just stick with a job stick with a company build up your. seniority keep your benefits. and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. yeah that would've been. my biggest piece of advice to myself [Interviewer]: okay what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: not much <laughter>. i guess. just my daughters you know they're. beautiful daughters and. i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people. aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so. that's the one thing i mean i wanted. five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but. um i'm. i guess that's the. biggest thing i can. think of to be proud of. is having my two daughters [Interviewer]: what would you say are some of your best qualities [Patient]: um. i'm a very loyal. friend and person. that's why. when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating. yeah very loyal um. very. <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly. and. caring and. um yeah i care about people. and i'm interested in people. and. i care about. animals as well. actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian. yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian. i'm a vegetarian because i really care about. feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and. you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured. and live a a tortuous life. just so we can eat 'em [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: so um. what was the question. do you remember the question [Interviewer]: okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for

therapy <therap>. therapy uh experts. have been really inspirational in the past two months [Interviewer]: tell me more about that [Patient]: well uh they believe that. um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and. this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and. um. the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think

time [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and. in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know. loosening up

doctor. um. you know taking control of my health and. experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started. juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh. the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that [Interviewer]: mhm do you feel like therapy is useful [Patient]: yes [Interviewer]: can you tell me about that [Patient]: uh i believe therapy is useful because. um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that. um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that. will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically. um therapy um. will help in overall health and mental. health i believe. for everybody [Interviewer]: yeah tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: last night um. i made a really great vegan uh. dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and. had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter> [Interviewer]: that's great [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: uh i would say uh. you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do. like my brain likes caffeine and sugar. whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx. is an example [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: it's very very hard it's a daily process [Interviewer]: tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself [Patient]: um i was uh. handling money for uh a business partner and. they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of. crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so. the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my. uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula [Interviewer]: yeah is there anything you regret [Patient]: um. no [Interviewer]: what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um. to start eating. raw fruits and vegetables every day [Interviewer]: okay how would your best friend

many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that. that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other. but because. my selfishness and because i just uh. had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh. i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been [Interviewer]: mm what's something you feel guilty about [Patient]: <sigh>. well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was. <sigh>. no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend. as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh. how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't. i never feel like i can help anyone. who i know who has a problem so [Interviewer]: when was the last time that happened [Patient]: oh that

them a lot better. you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]:

different i mean uh the place i was before was very it was a very small town. um you probably won't even notice it um on the map um so it was a big learning experience um 'cause you know the schools were a lot larger and . different cultures and ethnicities um. so it was a unique experience [Interviewer]: how often do you go back to your hometown [Patient]: um last time i've been back was probably about five years ago [Interviewer]: how does it compare to l_a [Patient]: um definitely different uh my aunt she lives in uh again she lives in a small town. um so if you wanna go to a movie

just kind of like the perfect area you know  you know i wanna live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  [Interviewer]: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [Patient]: um the big thing would probably be traffic i mean wherever you go there's gonna be traffic whether you're on the four o five or the one o one it's it's just traffic it it you know it can kill like two hours in your day which is huge  [Interviewer]: do you travel a lot [Patient]: um yeah quite a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel um you know usually overseas or um domestically um i travel

[Interviewer]: do you consider yourself an introvert [Patient]: um you know it depends um there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself uh an outgoing social person  [Interviewer]: what are some things that make you really mad [Patient]: um nothing too much i guess uh if you kind of uh make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit might get a bit a little bit uh annoyed but i don't think i would get really mad [Interviewer]: what do you do when you're annoyed [Patient]: um good question i'd probably say um i tend to eat a little bit more um. just kinda keep my mind off of it a little bit um but usually doesn't last that long so i just keep kinda like tend <te> i tend to eat out a little bit more more of kinda like maybe junk food or something [Interviewer]: how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um i think i'm pretty good i i rarely get mad um and if i do it doesn't really last that long um so i think i'm pretty good. at um i guess controlling my temper um again i really don't get angry so um it's not really an issue for me [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: um. i'd say during the elections um we were talking about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know who'd be the best fit uh for for the next presidency um . that kind of got a little bit uh i guess a little bit heated but it was more for uh i guess more for fun sake than anything else but it was an interesting conversation  [Interviewer]: what do you do to relax [Patient]: um. like to eat out a lot uh watch movies uh play video games um. just go out shop uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can in person it would probably be the best um. bowling photography um like to doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things um and of course electronics    [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um i'd say outgoing loyal um

to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep um other than that it's been pretty easy [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um i'd say a little bit sluggish tired um kind of reaction time is a little bit slower. um aside from that um i think nothing too much <mu> like too glaring or anything um the usual just being sluggish and. not moving as quickly as i should

that um. nothing else just be um kind of more. um wise with your money [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: um i'd probably say my best friend. he's kind of a you know helped me out and i helped him out as well so it's been uh kind of a great learning experience um. you know developing our uh our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times i bailed him out as well so it's kind of it's a mutual thing we do um. you know with each other um and it's you know it's like a great way to bond as well  [Interviewer]: what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: hmm. um i'd say probably going back uh back to korea um to visit my uh relatives um you know they they're a lot more different than uh i remember you know like. fifteen years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them. but um now that i see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually . pretty fun to talk

life [Patient]: um. i say um. guess work would be part of it um . buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i don't have any more

[Interviewer]: hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: okay so how are

<ss> and cultures [Interviewer]: i'd love to hear about one of your trips [Patient]: um uh well i mean um uh. i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i. i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for. spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um. and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um. there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then. i mean i still um. i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really. a sucker for that kind of stuff [Interviewer]: yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences [Patient]: um. i guess madagascar. was pretty much like just. really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and. it was like you were seeing a lot of. uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying. um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah [Interviewer]: nice what did you study at school [Patient]: um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education. degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to. just to get the um. just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um. the way the school system goes right now it um it just it. it turns people into. into um just um. just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way. the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that [Interviewer]: yeah what's your dream job [Patient]: that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work. with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal. um you know uh trajectory [Interviewer]: how hard is that [Patient]: um. i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via. any sort of um. legislation. except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know. facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways. i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so. i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system [Interviewer]: okay do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing [Patient]: uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think. um. i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know [Interviewer]: (laughter [Patient]: <laughter> yeah [Interviewer]: that makes sense [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [Patient]: yeah that's cool. um. i definitely um. uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so. a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot. so that's. quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too. tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to. you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise. um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and. but you know and i. i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too [Interviewer]: mhm how are you at controlling your temper [Patient]: um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of. bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so. there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam [Interviewer]: has that gotten you in trouble [Patient]: a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um. you know someone. in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so. usually some kind of sanity can prevail [Interviewer]: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [Patient]: oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out. you know um sabotaged or or definitely just. when uh what's the last specific time well i. you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um. the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of. i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her [Interviewer]: how did you feel in that moment [Patient]: i felt like um. i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt. in a way. good because. i get it. you know which is as opposed to not getting it. which is. even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank. of. the thing to get to to where. you can be a little more constructive about it it's like. you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty. but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel [Interviewer]: i understand [Patient]: there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because. there are people that will try to use that against you that's all. but i never really feel bad for [Interviewer]: yeah [Patient]: being angry about what i'm angry about [Interviewer]: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [Patient]: well when i was pregnant i wish i had um. like i said um i i went through um. such an awakening about realizing when i was being. sort of um undermined that um. that demanding my respect became a huge issue and. when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where. um i was set to be when the child arrived that i. stormed out. via what was a good survival mode before but. left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid. so [Interviewer]: wow [Patient]: yeah [Interviewer]: that sounds really hard [Patient]: it's fucked up. yeah [Interviewer]: tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [Patient]: i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and. cohesive. i don't. and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory [Interviewer]: okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [Patient]: um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong. <laughter>. um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to. sign um. sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the. there is nothing wrong with me i just. happen to. succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just. been you know. um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out [Interviewer]: what made you decide to do that [Patient]: overcautiousness [Interviewer]: okay tell me about your relationship with your family [Patient]: it's. horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality. intrigue and sabotage it's bad [Interviewer]: i'm sorry [Patient]: it's okay [Interviewer]: who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [Patient]: someone that i mean. there's been um. you know there's been some. some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of. really um. achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but. as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um. but otherwise you know a constant. you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um. get to that point [Interviewer]: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [Patient]: not so easy these days at all [Interviewer]: why [Patient]: um i'm being i've been um i'm not. completely centered and then there's been some. um actual you know. uh. people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment. and stuff like that [Interviewer]: what are you like when you don't sleep well [Patient]: um. i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible [Interviewer]: how have you been feeling lately [Patient]: i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um. i've been sort of. that i sort of have a bit of. um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it [Interviewer]: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: have you been diagnosed with depression [Patient]: no [Interviewer]: tell me about the last time you felt really happy [Patient]: um. there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much. blissed out person but. um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that. it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person. are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but. you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm. pretty close to my spirit so. um. i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way [Interviewer]: how would your best friend describe you [Patient]: um uh. uh. fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um. that you know that i'm this is off you guys. that i'm funny and that um. and that um. i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy [Interviewer]: what are some things you wish you could change about yourself [Patient]: um. just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with. and disconnect from the people that. manage to. to. drain me [Interviewer]: i see is there anything you regret [Patient]: i already said i regret the thing with um. leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being. um uh sort of. abused [Interviewer]: right what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [Patient]: get the fuck away from your mother <laughter>. sorry um you know and like a lot of the <th> um. and and. yeah and to open your eyes look what look what's going on [Interviewer]: okay what are you most proud of in your life [Patient]: i'm proud of my um spirit and my outlook and. my um my access to um what's really going on in the world and. my um awakeness i'm just proud of. me as a person [Interviewer]: that's great okay i think i have asked everything i need to [Patient]: okay [Interviewer]: thanks for sharing your thoughts with me [Patient]: you're welcome [Interviewer]: goodbye [Patient]: bye
